# Adoption

Use this page to choose scopes, connect tests and seed existing debt. The
[Python](../README.md#quickstart-python) and
[TypeScript](../README.md#quickstart-typescript) quickstarts show the commands in
order. Existing installations should start with [Upgrading](upgrading.md).

## Cut fewer, broader scopes first

A scope is a ceiling plus a language set, not a package. One scope per language per
top-level tree is the right opening move, even in a repo with twenty packages.

Every scope needs a lane or `coverage_optional = true`; otherwise `doctor` fails.
One lane can measure several scopes, so ten scopes do not require ten commands.
Each measured scope also needs a `scoped_tests` template for the edit loop. Start
with the scope boundaries your coverage commands and test routing can support.

Splitting later is cheap. Ratchet marks are keyed by path and function name with no scope
in the key, so re-cutting scopes leaves every recorded mark exactly where it was. Start
coarse, and split a scope the day you actually want a different ceiling or a different test
command for part of it.

When you do split, a nested scope wins over the scope that contains it. Declare `src` and
then `src/web`, and every file under `src/web` belongs to `src/web`: for scoring, for lane
reuse, for `test-scoped` routing, and for the ceiling `crapkit brief` hands an agent.

## Exclude, lane, or coverage_optional

Three ways to stop a file reading as untested debt, and they are not interchangeable.

| Choice | For | What it costs |
|---|---|---|
| `[exclude] globs` | generated, vendored, minified, build output | the code leaves the corpus completely and never scores again |
| a new `[[lane]]` | code you would test if a runner were wired to it | one command and one artifact path to keep true |
| `coverage_optional = true` | code no test can reach (entry points, deploy scripts, generated shims), and any scope whose language has no coverage parser | the scope still scores on complexity, and `remedy` narrows to `ok` or `decompose` |

The wrong pick in either direction is expensive. Excluding real code hides its debt
permanently and silently, and nothing ever reports what you excluded. Setting
`coverage_optional` on testable code turns every `add-tests` verdict in that scope into `ok`.
Prefer the lane whenever a runner could plausibly reach the code.

Sometimes none can. crapkit reads two coverage formats, coverage.py's JSON and istanbul's
`coverage-final.json`, so a Go, Rust or Swift scope has no lane to prefer. There
`coverage_optional` is the honest answer, not a shortcut, and `crapkit init` already wrote
it: any scope whose languages all lack a parser comes out of `init` carrying the key. What
is left for you is the first reason — code a test could reach but never will. See
[lanes.md](lanes.md#which-languages-a-lane-can-measure).

## What to do about `no_lane_over_target`

`reasons.no_lane_over_target` above zero in `crapkit next-item` blocks the stop condition:
rows the queue cannot hand out are over their ceiling anyway. Three real answers, in order:

1. **Declare the `[[lane]]`.** The default. The rows are measurable and nobody wired them.
2. **Set `coverage_optional`** on the scope, when no test can reach that code by design.
3. **Exclude it**, only when the files should not be scored at all.

`crapkit next-item --exclude FRAG` is not on that list. It is a session flag, so the count
goes to zero for you and the next session sees the rows again.

## `scoped_tests` belongs between doctor and coverage

The quickstarts run `crapkit init`, then `crapkit doctor`, then `crapkit coverage`. Fill in
the `[crapkit.scoped_tests]` table between the last two. `init` already wrote an entry per
scope, each under one comment line naming the form it chose: `{files}` where the scope's
own paths hold a test file, the whole-suite form where they do not (naming the repo's test
directory unless pytest's `testpaths` already collects it), a workspace's own
`npm run test -w <dir>`, or the runner's related-tests mode. Live where the repo's own
files prove the command and commented everywhere else, so uncommenting is usually the
whole job. `doctor` then repeats `init`'s lane probe: it names the interpreter and the
pytest and pytest-cov versions each coverage.py lane resolves to, fails a lane whose python
cannot import pytest-cov, prints a `note` for a lane an environment manager heads (`uv run
python -m pytest`), which it does not probe, and fails a `{files}` template on a scope
holding no test file.

Every python line it wrote names one launcher, the lockfile's where the repo has one:
`uv run python -m pytest ...` on a `uv.lock` repo, in the lane command, in the entries
here, and in the commented `[[lane]]` template. Step 3 measuring one environment while
step 4 tests another is the bug that rule exists to prevent, so keep the prefix on any
line you write by hand.

Skip it and nothing breaks loudly, which is the hazard. A repo with lanes and no templates
scores fine, doctor reports the gap as a warning, and every packet `crapkit brief` builds
hands back `commands.scoped_tests: null`. Step 4 of the burn-down loop then quietly does not
exist for any agent that ever works this repo.

## The two-templated-scopes trap

A `{files}` template on a scope whose tests live outside its `paths` is what springs it.
`init` no longer writes one there and `doctor` fails one it finds, but a hand-written
config can still carry it. A test file that lives outside every scope's `paths` routes to
the single scope that declares a template. With two templated scopes there is no single
owner, and `crapkit test-scoped tests/test_stats.py` exits 3. Naming a source file instead
routes fine and then hands the runner a source path to collect tests from: no tests ran,
runner exit 5, crapkit exit 1.

The way out is the whole-suite form. A template with no `{files}` placeholder runs exactly
as written, so the scope runs its own suite whichever of its files you name:

```toml
[crapkit.scoped_tests]
calc = "uv run python -m pytest tests/test_grade.py -q -p no:cacheprovider"
util = "uv run python -m pytest tests/test_stats.py -q -p no:cacheprovider"
```

`uv run` there is the launcher, not decoration: this repo carries a `uv.lock`, so that
is the prefix `init` wrote on its lane command and on every line of this table. A repo
with no lockfile names no launcher, and the same two lines start at `python`.

Keep `{files}` only for a scope whose tests live under its own `paths`, where narrowing to
the files you named is what you want.

## The first verify taints the baseline

An early `crapkit verify` can fail on pre-existing debt that no ratchet marks cover.
A failed verify then prevents later coverage runs from silently replacing its
baseline: subsequent runs print `run N is not the baseline: verify run M FAILED ...`
and compare against an older trusted run when one exists.

Prevent it by seeding first. `crapkit ratchet seed` records today's over-target functions as
accepted debt, so the first verify judges your edit rather than the repo's history.

Once it has happened, two escapes, both legitimate:

- Fix the findings the older baseline still shows, then run `crapkit verify` again.
- Accept the newer run by name: `crapkit verify --baseline N`, a visible act somebody can
  audit later.

`crapkit runs list` prints `verdict=-` on runs that rendered no verdict. See
[The trusted baseline](../README.md#the-trusted-baseline).

Since 0.4.5 the same failure also blocks `crapkit ratchet seed` and `crapkit ratchet prune`,
which used to take the newest trusted run and would happily sign marks off a `coverage` run
made after the failure. They now walk back with `verify` and say what they stepped over
(`skipped failed verify run 2`). If the failure stands in front of every trusted run there
is, both refuse and say a fresh `coverage` would be refused the same way. That is the case
you hit by running `verify` before seeding, so seed first
([ratchet.md](ratchet.md#seed-and-prune-pick-the-run-verify-picks)).

## Planning a campaign

Once the repo is seeded and green, somebody has to decide how many sessions run at once and
what that costs. The facts a plan needs, in the order it meets them. The timings come from
the 31,459-file repo the 0.4.5 performance work was refereed against.

**Two fan-outs, and the two N count different things.** `crapkit brief --batch N` emits one
packet per queue item, top N, and the orchestrator hands one packet to one session: its N is
a packet count. `crapkit worklist --batches N` cuts the active list into at most N groups
that share no file, and each group is one agent's territory: its N is an agent count.
Disjoint file sets are what make the resulting diffs merge, so the batches are the shape to
reach for once a session does more than one function.

The packets do not deal themselves one per batch, because the two commands rank
differently: `worklist` ranks by risk, which is ccn times recency-weighted churn, and the
queue behind `brief --batch` ranks by CRAP. On a six-file fixture repo:

```
$ crapkit worklist --batches 3
batch 1: 6 items in 3 files: calc/charlie.py, calc/delta.py, calc/foxtrot.py
batch 2: 2 items in 1 files: calc/alpha.py
batch 3: 4 items in 2 files: calc/bravo.py, calc/echo.py
```

`crapkit brief --batch 3` on that same run returned packets for `calc/alpha.py`,
`calc/echo.py` and `calc/bravo.py`: batch 2 once, batch 3 twice, batch 1 never. So an agent
holding a batch briefs its own rows. Every `batches[].entries[]` row carries `path` and
`function`, which are the two arguments `brief` takes, so the session runs one
`crapkit brief PATH "FUNCTION"` per item it picks up.

**One `brief --batch N` per wave, never N `brief` calls**, when it is the orchestrator
dealing packets. The batch call reads the store, the churn log and the ratchet file once,
and since 0.4.5 it shingles the repo once for the whole batch instead of once per packet. A
batch of 5 went from 11.8 s to 5.2 s, output byte-identical. That saving is the
orchestrator's; a session briefing the handful of items in its own batch pays a cold start
either way.

**The coupling cache is per checkout, and the first run in each pays for it.** Ranked
co-change pairs live in `.crapkit/coupling-cache-v1.json`, which `init` already gitignores
along with the rest of `.crapkit/`. Warm, `coupling` costs 0.11 s instead of 1.05 s and
`worklist --batches` 62% less. A fleet of ten worktrees is ten cold runs, once each. Passing
`--min-support` or `--min-confidence` off their defaults bypasses the cache every time, so
keep the fleet on the defaults unless somebody is investigating.

**Every mutation worker uses a kept worktree**, including the default of one.
Budget one checkout per worker and reclaim the pool with `crapkit mutate --drop-pool`.
See [mutation worktrees](configuration.md#mutation-worktrees) for preparation,
concurrent runs and cleanup.

**`trend` and `report` write.** Both fill a per-run rollup table on first read, which is what
takes `trend` from 4.58 s to 0.04 s. A session holding a checkout it must not write to should
not be the one running them, though the write is best effort and neither command fails when
it cannot land.

Nothing skips `verify`, so budget one full run per session that finishes an item. Caching a
verdict on HEAD plus the dirty file names was measured for 0.4.5 and rejected: that key
cannot see a second edit to a file that was already dirty, and a gate that misses one edit is
worse than a slow gate.

Upgrade before sessions fan out. Measure once, review any function-identity changes,
and commit the resulting ratchet changes on the shared starting branch. The
[upgrade guide](upgrading.md) separates metric restamping from identity mapping;
a blanket seed cannot establish which callback an old mark belongs to.

## Put repo traps in `notes`

Every repo teaches its agents something that no config key expresses: a module that must
stay importable without side effects, a generated file that looks hand-written, a helper
everything already imports. Put it in `[crapkit] notes` for the repo, or in a `[[scope]]`'s
own `notes` when it binds one tree only.

`crapkit brief` carries both into every packet, so the trap arrives with the work instead of
living in a commit message nobody reads. Keys are documented in
[configuration.md](configuration.md).

## Install the agent surface last

Wire the harness once the repo scores and `crapkit doctor` is clean. Do it earlier and the
`crapkit-onboard` skill points at a config that does not exist yet, while the `crapkit` skill
points at a store with no run in it.

**Claude Code users install the plugin.** One artifact, versioned against the CLI:

```
claude plugin marketplace add JeanFrancoisGagne/crapkit
claude plugin install crapkit@crapkit
```

It carries three skills, the read-side MCP server, and one advisory PostToolUse hook that
names functions an edit pushed over their ceiling. The hook never blocks; the commit gate
stays the only enforcement point. After a CLI upgrade, `crapkit doctor --plugin-root PATH`
compares the two and prints nothing when they agree.

The plugin registers that hook on `Edit|Write`. A session that writes source through a
shell heredoc gets no advisory until the consumer adds a second entry of their own with
matcher `Bash`, which costs one `git rev-parse` plus one `git status` per shell call and
is therefore opt-in. The snippet is in the `crapkit-onboard` skill. `doctor --plugin-root`
does not cover that entry: it reads the plugin's own `hooks/hooks.json` and nothing else, so
a protocol bump shows up for the shipped matcher and stays silent for the one you wrote.
Re-check it by hand after a CLI upgrade.

Codex users can install the three skills and MCP server through its own plugin manager:

```
codex plugin marketplace add https://github.com/JeanFrancoisGagne/crapkit.git
codex plugin add crapkit@crapkit
```

The advisory hook instructions above configure Claude Code's PostToolUse event.
After a CLI upgrade, follow
[plugin and MCP client updates](upgrading.md#plugin-and-mcp-clients): refresh the
marketplace first, update the installed plugin, then check its version and start a
fresh client session.

| Harness | What it gets |
|---|---|
| Claude Code | the plugin: three skills, the MCP server, the advisory hook |
| Codex | the plugin: three skills and the MCP server |
| other MCP clients (Cursor, Zed, Continue) | `crapkit mcp` as a stdio server: twelve read-side tools, no skills, no hook; calls can write caches and store metadata |
| anything else | the pre-commit hook and CI, which are git and shell and need no harness at all |

A runtime with a skills directory but no marketplace can copy `plugin/skills/*` into it and
get the skills alone. MCP wiring is in [agent-json.md](agent-json.md#mcp-server).
