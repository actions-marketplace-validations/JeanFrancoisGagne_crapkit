# The machine surface

This page defines payloads from commands with `--json`, the JSON-only `next-item`
command, and the read-side MCP tools. For the edit sequence, use
[the agent workflow](../AGENTS.md#1-the-packet). For an existing integration moving
to a new reader, use [Upgrading](upgrading.md).

Jump to [packets](#brief), [verification](#verify), [errors](#errors),
[MCP setup](#mcp-server) or [portable exports](portable-records.md).

## The `schema` field

Every `--json` payload carries `schema`, currently `1`.

```json
{"...": "...", "schema": 1}
```

| Change | Bumps `schema`? |
|---|---|
| A field is added | No |
| A field is removed | Yes |
| A field changes type | Yes |
| A field's meaning changes | Yes |

Parse defensively for additions and pin on `schema` for the rest. A payload whose `schema`
is higher than the one you were written against may have dropped or retyped something you
read.

Two more house rules that hold across every payload:

- **Keys are sorted** and scored rows carry no timestamps. A new stored run can change
  envelope fields such as `run_id`; compare row content when comparing measurements.
- **stdout carries exactly one JSON object.** Warnings, progress, lane chatter and gate
  findings all go to stderr, so `crapkit ... --json 2>/dev/null` is always parseable. A
  command that dies prints one object too: see [Errors](#errors).

`next-item` is the exception to the flag: it has no `--json` because it only ever emits JSON.

TSV exports and portable baselines follow the separate
[portable record encoding](portable-records.md); JSON fields preserve their original strings.

Function rows carry `occurrence` alongside their real `start` and `end` lines. A new
measurement numbers functions sharing a start line from 1 in source creation order,
including functions with different names. `0` means an older row has no such position.
Use `(path, long_name or function, start, occurrence)` to distinguish rows within a
run. The raw function signature stays unchanged. This field appears in `next-item`,
`worklist`, `brief.scored`, `brief.file_functions` and `rescore.functions`; adding it
does not change JSON schema 1.

---

## `next-item`

The top of the burn-down queue: the rows a lane measures, whose remedy is not `ok`,
ranked by **`crap` descending**. That ordering is the difference from
[`worklist`](#worklist), which ranks the same run by risk and lists rows this command
never offers, so the two do not lead with the same function.

```
$ crapkit next-item
```

```json
{
  "commit": "8c14f3daa8e88230c5b702d8f452ee2616d4de30",
  "empty": false,
  "item": {
    "authors": 1,
    "ccn": 14,
    "ccn_std": 14,
    "cognitive": 14,
    "commits": 2,

    "end": 27,
    "est_splits": 3,
    "est_uncovered_paths": 8,
    "flag": "measured",
    "function": "classify( score , attempts , late , bonus )",
    "handle": "classify",
    "nesting": 3,
    "nloc": 24,
    "occurrence": 1,
    "path": "calc/grade.py",
    "remedy": "decompose",

    "target": 6,
    "uncovered_lines": [8, 10, 12, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 24, 26]
  },
  "run_id": 1,
  "schema": 1,
  "skipped_no_lane": 0,
  "stale": false
}
```

### Envelope

| Key | Type | Always | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `run_id` | int | yes | The scored run these numbers come from. |
| `commit` | string | yes | That run's commit, full sha. |
| `empty` | bool | yes | Whether there is work to hand out. |
| `skipped_no_lane` | int | yes | Rows above the floor that no lane covers. They are excluded from ranking because their `cov = 0` is a tooling gap, not a testing gap. |
| `stale` | bool | yes | `true` when the ranked run's commit is not HEAD, so `cov`, `crap` and `uncovered_lines` describe an older tree. Same field, same rule as [`worklist`](#worklist). |
| `item` | object | when `empty` is false and `--top` is absent or 1 | The one item. |
| `items` | array | when `empty` is false and `--top` > 1 | Up to N items, same object shape. |
| `skipped_claimed` | int | only when a claim actually hid something | How many rows another session is holding. Absent, never `0`, so a store nobody claims in emits the same JSON it always did. |
| `reasons` | object | when `empty` is true | Why the queue is empty. |

### `item` fields

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `scope` | string | The scope that owns the file. |
| `path` | string | Repo-relative source path, forward slashes. |
| `function` | string | The lizard long name, including the spaced parameter list. `brief` and `explain` also accept the bare identifier. |
| `handle` | string | The short name form: the bare identifier, or `(anonymous)#N` for a function lizard could not name. Unlike `start` it names a position rather than a line, so it survives the edit this item asks for. `brief`, `explain` and `claims release` all take it. |
| `start`, `end` | int | 1-based inclusive line span. |
| `occurrence` | int | Source creation order among functions sharing `start`, from 1; `0` on older rows with no recorded position. |
| `ccn` | int | `min(ccn_std, ccn_mod)`. This is what the gate and the ratchet judge. |
| `ccn_std` | int | Standard cyclomatic complexity. |
| `cognitive` | int | Sonar-spec cognitive complexity, measured in every language crapkit scans. Reporting only, never gated. |
| `nloc` | int | Non-comment lines of code. |
| `nesting` | int | Maximum nesting depth. A Python row reads it off crapkit's cognitive pass: the deepest that pass's nesting stack gets, one level per `if`, `elif`, `else`, `for`, `while`, `except` and comprehension `for`, none for `with`, `try`, `finally`, `match`, `case` or a nested `def` (a nested function's blocks count on its own row). A flat function of seven `if`s reads 1, a three-deep one reads 3, an `if` inside a `with` inside an `if` reads 2. Every other language keeps lizard's ND column. |
| `cov` | float | Branch coverage in the span, 0.0 to 1.0. |
| `flag` | string | `measured`, `untested`, `no-lane` or `cc-only`. See the [README](../README.md#flags-why-a-coverage-number-is-missing). |
| `crap` | float | The score. |
| `remedy` | string | `decompose`, `split-lines`, `add-tests` or `ok`. `split-lines` means another function shares the source lines, or a Python def's body starts on the line its signature ends under a coverage.py lane, which reads that body as the `def` statement that runs at import; either way no test lowers the score until the definitions, or the signature and its body, are on separate lines. Judged against `target`, the ceiling `crapkit.toml` holds now, not the one the run was scored under: an uncommitted ceiling edit moves the remedy, and what the queue offers, before the next run lands. |
| `target` | int | This scope's effective ceiling. |
| `commits`, `authors` | int | Churn for the file in the window. |
| `est_splits` | int | `0` when `ccn <= target`, else `ceil(ccn / target)`. Roughly how many functions this needs to become. |
| `est_uncovered_paths` | int | `round((1 - cov) * ccn)`. Decision paths no test walks. |
| `uncovered_lines` | array or **null** | See below. |
| `uncovered_lines_note` | string | Present **only** when `uncovered_lines` is null. |

### `uncovered_lines`: null is not `[]`

| Value | Means |
|---|---|
| `[8, 11, 14]` | The artifacts answered. These lines never ran. |
| `[]` | The artifacts answered. Nothing in this span is dark. |
| `null` | No artifact could answer. Read `uncovered_lines_note`. |

The distinction is load-bearing. An empty list is what a fully covered function returns, so
returning `[]` for a file no artifact measured would tell you there is nothing left to test.

**The note is prose and may be reworded; `flag` is the contract.** Branch on `flag`, and
print the note for a human. These three are what it reads like today, captured from real
runs:

```json
{
  "flag": "measured",
  "uncovered_lines": null,
  "uncovered_lines_note": "lane 'py': files in its scopes changed since .crapkit/cov/py.json was written (uncommitted edits count), so its line numbers are stale — commit or revert them, then rerun `crapkit coverage`"
}
```

```json
{
  "flag": "untested",
  "uncovered_lines": null,
  "uncovered_lines_note": "no lane artifact measured app/m.py (flag untested: no test imports it, so coverage records nothing for it; write the first test that imports app/m.py)"
}
```

```json
{
  "flag": "cc-only",
  "uncovered_lines": null,
  "uncovered_lines_note": "scope 'tools' sets coverage_optional = true, so no artifact can name uncovered lines for tools/helper.py"
}
```

A repo with no `[[lane]]` at all answers `no [[lane]] declared, so no artifact can say
which lines are dark`, and an artifact that will not parse answers `unreadable lane
artifact: ...`. The key is opt-in, so a repo whose artifacts answer never emits it at all.

The move differs per flag. On `measured` a lane did speak about the file and its artifact
has since gone stale: commit or revert the edits, then rerun `crapkit coverage`. Nothing
rereads the artifact until a run does, so committing alone leaves the lines null. On
`untested` no test imports the file, so no artifact was ever going to mention it: the whole
span is dark and the first test is the move, not another `coverage` run. On `cc-only` the
scope set `coverage_optional`, so no artifact can ever name lines for it and nothing to do
will change that. A `no-lane` row is a wiring gap; `next-item` never hands one out.

### `reasons`, and the stop condition

An empty queue must say what was filtered, or the silence reads as done.

```json
{
  "empty": true,
  "reasons": {
    "all_remaining_at_or_under_target": 4,
    "below_floor": 1,
    "churn_window_months": 12,
    "excluded_by_flag": 0,
    "no_churn_in_window": 0,
    "no_lane": 0,
    "no_lane_over_target": 0
  }
}
```

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `below_floor` | Rows under `worklist_floor`, counted in SQL rather than fetched. Every one is at or under its ceiling: an over-target row is queued whatever its ccn. |
| `no_lane` | Rows above the floor whose scope no lane covers. |
| `no_lane_over_target` | The subset of those that are over their ceiling. Debt the queue is not allowed to rank, because a `no-lane` row's `cov = 0` is a tooling gap. |
| `no_churn_in_window` | Rows in files with no commits in the churn window. |
| `excluded_by_flag` | Rows an `--exclude` fragment matched. |
| `churn_window_months` | The window that produced those counts, echoed back. |
| `all_remaining_at_or_under_target` | **Present only when candidates remained but every one has `remedy: "ok"`.** |

**The stop condition is `empty == true` AND `skipped_claimed` 0-or-absent AND
`reasons.no_lane_over_target` 0-or-absent.** `empty` alone says the queue has nothing to
hand out, which two things cause without the work being done: a claim hides a row from
every session, and a scope no lane measures can hold debt that never ranks. The
`worklist_floor` is not one of them. It withheld no over-target row on its way here,
whatever that row's ccn. Do not loop on "is there an item" either, because a function at
ccn 6 with 100% coverage clears the `ccn >= 5` floor forever and would be handed back
every time. The rule is stated once, with the moves, in
[AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md#the-termination-rule).

### Claims

`--claim` records a claim on each item it hands out. Filtering is unconditional: a claimed
row is hidden from every session, including the one that took it, because a claim only one
session honours is worthless.

```
$ crapkit next-item --claim     # returns the item, and holds it
$ crapkit next-item             # {"empty": false, "skipped_claimed": 1, "item": {...next one...}}
```

`--claim` on a finished queue holds nothing, so an exploratory call cannot hide tomorrow's
top item.

A claim is released three ways: `verify` releases it once the function sits at its ceiling
or its commit leaves the history, `runs prune` drops claims older than the oldest kept run,
and `crapkit claims release` closes one by hand.

---

## `claims`

Who is holding what. A fleet reads this to see why the queue handed back nothing.

```
$ crapkit claims --json
```

```json
{
  "claims": [
    {
      "commit": "9a1d11895c5ff5b791b497a13294494fdab949ce",
      "created_at": "2026-08-23T01:39:07Z",
      "handle": "classify",
      "id": 1,
      "long_name": "classify( score , attempts , late , bonus )",
      "path": "calc/grade.py"
    }
  ],
  "open": 1,
  "schema": 1
}
```

`commit` is HEAD when the claim was taken, not the snapshot's commit: it describes the tree
the session started editing, which is what makes the ancestor test at verify meaningful.

`handle` is the name `next-item` handed the claim out under, stored rather than
recomputed. On an anonymous function it is the only string that releases the right claim:
every anonymous function in a file carries the same `(anonymous)` long name, and the
handle stays valid after the session's own edit moves the lines. `null` on a claim taken
before handles existed, or by a caller that had none.

Release takes any name form:

```
$ crapkit claims release calc/grade.py classify --json
{"released": 1, "schema": 1}

$ crapkit claims release app/parse_csv.py "(anonymous)#2" --json
{"released": 1, "schema": 1}

$ crapkit claims release --all --json
{"released": 3, "schema": 1}
```

A release naming a claim that is not open is exit 1, and the message lists what is:

```
crapkit: no open claim on 'classify' in calc/grade.py — open: calc/grade.py audit( rows , strict , cap , floor , verbose )
```

---

## `brief`

The start-editing packet. One call returns everything a burn-down session would
otherwise open the file, grep the callers and read `git log` to find out, which is why
[AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md#1-the-packet) makes it step one of the loop rather than step
two.

```
$ crapkit brief app/parse_csv.py parse_row --json

### What the session reads

| Key | Type | Nullable | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `run_id`, `commit` | int, string | no | The scored run and its commit. |
| `path`, `function` | string | no | The resolved function. `function` is always the long name, whichever form you asked with. |
| `handle` | string | no | The short name form for this row: the bare identifier, or `(anonymous)#N`. Same value and same rules as [`next-item`'s](#item-fields), so a packet and a queue item name one function one way. |
| `remedy` | string | no | `decompose`, `split-lines`, `add-tests` or `ok`. Promoted out of `scored` because it is the branch the session takes; `scored.remedy` carries the same value. Judged against `target`, today's ceiling, as on `next-item`; so is every `remedy` in `file_functions`. |
| `est_splits`, `est_uncovered_paths` | int | no | The budget, from the same code `next-item` publishes it with. Formulas under [`item` fields](#item-fields). |
| `source` | string | no | The function's own text, `start` to `end` inclusive, newlines intact. The packet is editable without a second read of the file. |
| `params` | array of object | no | Its parameters in declaration order, each `{name, type}`: `name` as declared, `type` the annotation as lizard printed it, or `null` when there is none. A new test can call the function without opening the file. `scored.params` is the count of these. |
| `scored` | object | no | The whole scored row: the 17 fields above, including `occurrence`, `params` and `ccn_mod`. `next-item` does not carry the latter two. |
| `target` | int | no | The scope's effective ceiling. |
| `stale` | bool | no | `true` when `commit` is not HEAD, so every number here describes an older tree. Run `commands.refresh` first. |
| `file_functions` | array | no | Every scored function in the same file: `function`, `start`, `end`, `occurrence`, `ccn`, `crap`, `remedy`. What an extracted helper lands beside, and what names are already taken. |
| `file_totals` | object | no | That file rolled up: `functions`, `over_target`, `crap_load`. |
| `gate_rule` | object | no | What the gate will judge this edit by. Below. |
| `commands` | object | no | The rest of the loop, filled in for this file and this scope. Below. |
| `lane` | object | **yes** | The lane whose artifact produced `cov` and `uncovered_lines`, verbatim from the config: `name`, `command`, `artifact`, `parser`, `cwd`, `env`, `timeout_seconds`. A session rerunning the lane by hand needs the cwd and the env as declared; reconstructing them from the command string is how the reruns drift. `null` when no lane covers the scope, which is a `no-lane` row. |
| `versions` | object | no | `{analysis_version, crapkit, lizard, python}`: the tool versions and the metric's own version behind every number in the packet. Marks and scores from two `analysis_version`s are not one series. |
| `notes` | object | no | `{repo, scope}`: the `notes` lines the config carries repo-wide and for this scope, each an array of strings, or `null` where the config declares none. See [configuration.md](configuration.md#crapkit). |
| `attempts` | array | no | Every claim ever taken on this function, oldest first, each `{opened, closed}`: UTC timestamps, `closed` `null` while the claim is still open. `[]` is a first attempt; anything else means a session took it before, and `regrowth.history` says whether its split held. |
| `regrowth` | object | no | `{regrown, history}`. Below. |
| `ratchet_mark` | float | **yes** | `null` when the function carries no mark, and also when the repo has no ratchet file at all. Read under the function's own ratchet key, so twins sharing a long name report their own marks and not each other's. |
| `churn` | object | **yes** | `{commits, authors, weight}`, or `null` when the file has no commits in the window. |
| `coupling` | array | no | Up to 5 partners, each `{path, support, confidence, is_test}`. Empty when nothing clears support 5 and confidence 0.5. |
| `duplication_twins` | array | no | Near-duplicate functions, each with `similarity` and `contained` plus its location. Empty is normal. |
| `uncovered_lines` | array | **yes** | Same null-vs-empty contract as `next-item`. |
| `uncovered_lines_note` | string | conditional | Present only when `uncovered_lines` is null. |

Since 0.4.5 `lane`, `target` and `commands.scoped_tests` all describe one scope: the one
whose declared `paths` entry sits deepest on this file, which is the rule the run scored it
under too. Three readers used to answer that question separately, so a packet on a file under
nested scopes (`src` and `src/web`) could carry the deeper scope's lane and test command
beside the shallower scope's ceiling.

### `gate_rule`: what the edit is judged by

Three limits an edit can fail and the two facts that qualify them, in one object, so a
session need not read the config to learn which number it is aiming at.

| Key | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `ceiling` | int | The scope's effective target. `rescore --gate` compares `ccn` against this and nothing else. Same value as `target`. |
| `binds` | string | The gate's scope rule as one sentence, the same string in every packet: `changed functions only; a ratchet mark pardons standing debt at or under it`. Print it, do not branch on it. |
| `ratchet_mark` | float or null | The mark this function already carries. At or under it, an edit inside the function passes `rescore --gate` and `verify`'s gate alike. Push it past the mark and both refuse, `rescore --gate` at exit 6 and `verify` at exit 6 as well since #29. Exit 7 is what is left for a mark that rose in a function the diff never touched. |
| `mark_age_days` | int or null | How old that mark is, measured from the newest commit that touched the ratchet file, never from the wall clock. |
| `diff_uncovered_max` | int or null | The configured ceiling on changed lines with no coverage. `null` means warn only: `verify` prints the count and exits 0. |

### `commands`: steps 3 to 5, already written

| Key | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `gate` | string | `rescore --gate` for this file. Step 3 of the loop. |
| `scoped_tests` | string or null | A `crapkit test-scoped` call for the packet's literal file. It selects the scope's template and executes it from the project root with the inherited environment and literal filename transport. `null` when the scope declares no template; `doctor` warns about the gap. |
| `scoped_tests_note` | string | Present **only** when `scoped_tests` is `null`, naming the scope that declares no template. |
| `verify` | string | The `verify` call. Step 5, the only authoritative one. |
| `refresh` | string | The `coverage --reuse-unchanged` call that refreshes this packet. It reuses a lane only at the same clean HEAD with unchanged configuration, inherited environment and coverage/JUnit bytes, or, for a lane that declares `inputs`, while nothing under those paths, its lane table or its `env` changed and its coverage/JUnit bytes match; otherwise it runs the lane. Run it first when `stale` is `true`. |
| `refresh_writes_run` | bool | Always `true`. `refresh` appends a scored coverage run to `.crapkit/crap.sqlite`. Other commands can write caches or test artifacts; this field does not promise filesystem read-only execution. |

Each value is a whole command line. Run it as given to preserve filename quoting
and the refresh reuse policy. Simple paths remain readable. POSIX commands use
shell quoting; Windows commands support cmd.exe and PowerShell, using an encoded
PowerShell command when a filename could trigger shell expansion.

With a scoped template and without one:

```json
{"gate": "crapkit rescore calc/grade.py --gate",
 "refresh": "crapkit coverage --reuse-unchanged", "refresh_writes_run": true,
 "scoped_tests": "crapkit test-scoped calc/grade.py",
 "verify": "crapkit verify"}

{"gate": "crapkit rescore calc/grade.py --gate",
 "refresh": "crapkit coverage --reuse-unchanged", "refresh_writes_run": true,
 "scoped_tests": null,
 "scoped_tests_note": "no [crapkit.scoped_tests] template for scope 'calc'",
 "verify": "crapkit verify"}
```

All four commands resolve the `crapkit` console script on PATH, including the
Windows encoded form. Activate the intended environment before executing them.
`test-scoped` then runs the owning scope's configured template; a template with
no `{files}` still runs its declared arguments unchanged.

`refresh` is what `stale: true` asks for, and the only thing that answers it. `stale`
compares the run's commit against HEAD, so nothing clears it but a run landing on the
current commit. Another `brief` re-reads the same snapshot and reports the same staleness.

### `regrowth`: did this get fixed before?

| Key | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `regrown` | bool | `true` when this function's `ccn` fell between two runs in `history` and rose again at any later point. An earlier decomposition did not hold, and repeating it will not either. Coverage plays no part: a function whose `crap` fell because tests arrived has not regrown. |
| `history` | array | One `[run_id, ccn]` pair for every stored run that scored the function, oldest first, whatever the run's kind: an inventory run, a partial run and a refused verify each count. A function one run has seen has one pair. |

### `coupling[]` and `duplication_twins[]`

| Key | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `is_test` | bool | On a coupling partner: the path is a test file. Test paths are excluded from the corpus unconditionally, so a coupled test never appears in `file_functions` or the worklist, and it is still the file your edit breaks. |
| `contained` | bool | On a twin: every shingle of the smaller function appears in the larger. Containment, not mere similarity, so one of the two can call the other instead of being rewritten. |

### Name resolution

`NAME` takes five forms, all resolving to the same row:

| Form | Example |
|---|---|
| the long name | `"parse_row( text , strict , sep , header )"` |
| the bare identifier | `parse_row` |
| the function's start line | `1` |
| the ordinal handle | `"(anonymous)#2"` |
| the twin selector | `"__post_init__#2"` |

The bare identifier is the leading token of the long name, before the parameter list.
Only some of lizard's readers spell that list with parentheses: Rust prints
`route cmd : & Cmd` and Go prints `Classify n int`, so the identifier there ends at the
first space and the bare names are `route` and `Classify`.

Matching is exact first. A NAME that IS a long name or a bare identifier resolves to
that function alone, so `route` never also answers with `route_chain` and `route_num`.
A NAME that names no function falls back to a substring search over the file's long
names, which is what turns a half-remembered name into a list of candidates. `brief`
and `explain` run the identical rule, so one string cannot name one function in a
packet and three in a trajectory.

The start line resolves a function only when that line names one source position.
When several functions start there, the command refuses the numeric selector and lists
their handles. Use the handle to select one. `explain` resolves against the run `brief`
reads, the newest trusted one. When that run dropped the file, `brief` refuses it and
`explain` reads the newest trusted run that still holds it. On a file the newest trusted
run holds, both answer alike:

```
$ crapkit explain calc/grade.py 1
calc/grade.py  classify( score , attempts , late , bonus )
  run   1 @ fd47cb9c767 coverage  ccn  13  cov   39%  crap     51.6  measured
  mark: no ratchet file
  uncovered lines: 6, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20
```

The two commands word a miss differently. `brief` lists the lines that do open a function;
`explain` reports the NAME it could not resolve, because a line that names nothing is one
of several ways its lookup comes back empty:

```
$ crapkit brief calc/grade.py 12
crapkit: no function starts at line 12 in calc/grade.py in the latest scored run — it starts functions at: 1, 24

$ crapkit explain calc/grade.py 12
crapkit: no function matching '12' in calc/grade.py appears in any run
```

The ordinal handle names a function with no name of its own, which every payload prints
as `(anonymous)`. `N` counts the file's anonymous functions from the top, so
`(anonymous)#2` is the second one wherever it has drifted to. That is why `handle` carries
it and not the start line. An ordinal past the end is exit 1 listing the handles the file
does hold:

```
crapkit: no (anonymous)#5 in app/parse_csv.py in the latest scored run — it holds: (anonymous)#1, (anonymous)#2
```

`explain` resolves the handle the same way, against the run `brief` reads.
Note that the store keys a function's identity on its long name, so one file's anonymous
functions share one history there: the handle picks the position, and `explain`'s history
covers every anonymous function in the file.

Twins sharing one long name are one candidate, not an ambiguity: the worst-scoring twin
wins, the same rule the queue ranks on. Anything genuinely ambiguous or absent is exit 1
with the candidates listed:

```
crapkit: no function named 'nope' in calc/grade.py in the latest scored run — it holds: _adjusted, _band, classify, extra, summarize
```

The twin selector picks one of them instead. `NAME#2` is the second function of that name
in file order, `NAME#3` the third — the same ordinals the ratchet keys their marks on, so
`ratchet_mark` in the packet belongs to the function the packet opened. An ordinal past
the last twin is exit 1:

```
crapkit: no __post_init__#5 in calc/iso_cost.py in the latest scored run — it holds 2 function(s) named '__post_init__'
```

Only a whole-number tail selects: a long name that merely contains a `#`, such as an
Objective-C or C++ operator name, resolves as itself.

### `--batch N`

One call, N packets, one read of the store.

```
$ crapkit brief --batch 3 --json
```

```json
{
  "commit": "9c7eed1a91d12a4b84b51ecefbbf9e1f5551d216",
  "packets": [{"function": "parse_line( text , strict , sep , header )", "...": "..."},
              {"function": "parse_row( text , strict , sep , header )", "...": "..."}],
  "run_id": 4,
  "schema": 1,
  "stale": false
}
```

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `packets` | Up to N packets, in `next-item` order (`crap` descending), skipping every function an open claim holds, as `next-item` does. Each one is the object above without `schema`; it keeps its own `run_id`, `commit` and `stale`. |
| `run_id`, `commit`, `stale` | Repeated on the envelope, because every packet in one call comes from one run. |
| `skipped_claimed` | Present only when an open claim hid a queue row: how many it hid, the count `next-item` prints under the same key. Absent, never `0`. |
| `schema` | `1`, as everywhere. |

`--batch` takes no `FILE` or `NAME`: the queue picks the functions. It exists so an
orchestrator pays the store, churn-log and ratchet-file reads once for a whole fleet
instead of once per session, and so every session starts at step 1 with nothing left to
look up. Since 0.4.5 it also shingles the repo once per batch rather than once per packet,
which is what `duplication_twins` costs: a batch of 5 on the 31,459-file corpus the 0.4.5
work was measured against fell from 11.8 s to 5.2 s, output byte-identical. The run's
shingle index now lives in the store: `inventory` and `coverage` write it as they record the
run, the first `brief` or `duplication` on a `verify` run builds and stores it, and every
later packet shingles only its own function. Hand one packet to one session, and see
[Multi-agent sessions](../AGENTS.md#multi-agent-sessions) for the file-disjoint split
that keeps their diffs mergeable.

---

## `worklist`

The risk map: every admitted function ranked by complexity times churn. It lists rows the
queue will never hand out, so it never empties and carries no stop condition.

```
$ crapkit worklist --json
```

```json
{
  "active": [
    {
      "authors": 1, "ccn": 7, "ccn_std": 7, "commits": 2, "cov": 0.0, "crap": 56.0,
      "end": 15, "flag": "measured", "function": "render( rows , wide , totals , header )",
      "handle": "render", "nloc": 12, "occurrence": 1, "path": "calc/report.py",
      "ratchet_mark": null, "remedy": "decompose", "risk": 3.5, "scope": "calc", "start": 4,
      "weight": 0.5
    },
    {
      "authors": 1, "ccn": 14, "ccn_std": 14, "commits": 2, "cov": 0.45,
      "crap": 46.60950000000001, "end": 27, "flag": "measured",
      "function": "classify( score , attempts , late , bonus )", "handle": "classify",
      "nloc": 24, "occurrence": 1, "path": "calc/grade.py", "ratchet_mark": null,
      "remedy": "decompose", "risk": 0.0252, "scope": "calc", "start": 4, "weight": 0.0018
    }
  ],
  "active_total": 2,
  "churn_window_months": 12,
  "commit": "8c14f3daa8e88230c5b702d8f452ee2616d4de30",
  "dormant_count": 0,
  "dormant_top": [],
  "floor": 5,
  "run_id": 1,
  "schema": 1,
  "stale": false
}
```

| Key | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `run_id`, `commit` | int, string | The run ranked, and its commit. |
| `stale` | bool | `true` when the run's commit is not HEAD. In plain output this also prints a stderr warning; in JSON it is only this field. |
| `floor` | int | The effective `worklist_floor`, echoed so a caller need not read the config. |
| `churn_window_months` | int | Same. |
| `active` | array | The queue: files with churn in the window, ranked, capped at `--top` or `worklist_top`. |
| `active_total` | int | Active rows admitted before the cap: what `--top` or `worklist_top` hid. The plain header prints it as `50 of 3980 active (worklist_top 50)`, or `(--top N)` when the flag set the cap. Not the over-ceiling count `trend` and the coverage summary carry: a row is active for its churn, whatever its score. |
| `dormant_count` | int | How many ranked entries have zero churn in the window. |
| `dormant_top` | array | The first 10 dormant entries, same shape. Sleeping hazards, recorded without clogging the queue. |
| `batches` | array | Only with `--batches N`. |

Each entry carries `scope`, `path`, `function`, `start`, `end`, `occurrence`, `ccn`, `ccn_std`, `nloc`,
`commits`, `authors`, `weight`, `risk`, plus `flag`, `remedy`, `crap` and `cov` from the
run that scored it, and `ratchet_mark`: the committed mark's value, or `null` when the
function carries no mark or the repo has no marks file. The mark is read under the
function's own ratchet key, so twins sharing a long name report their own marks and not
each other's. `handle` is the short name form `brief`, `explain` and `claims release` take:
the bare identifier, or `(anonymous)#N` for a function lizard could not name. The four run fields are `null` on an inventory-only run, which scored no
verdict. `worklist` still ranks on complexity times churn, never on `crap`: `next-item` is
the queue ordered by score, and `brief` the whole packet.

`floor` orders the list and withholds no debt. A function the ranked run scored over its
ceiling is listed whatever its ccn. An inventory-only run has no such verdict to read, and
there the floor is the whole rule.

**`worklist` and `next-item` are two views of one state, and they disagree on purpose.**
Both read the newest **trusted** run, which since 0.4.5 is one rule with one answer: a
`coverage` run, or a `verify` run whose verdict passed. A `partial` run and a failed verify
are refused, because a partial measured a fraction of the suite with its CRAP inflated to
match, and a failed verify's numbers can come off a red tree. `worklist` used to admit both
and rank off them while `next-item` picked its item off an older run, so the two commands
answered one question differently. An inventory-only run never splits them either: `worklist`
falls back to it only when no trusted run exists at all, ranking complexity alone.
`worklist` is the risk map: every admitted function ranked by `risk`, including rows at or
under their ceiling and rows no lane measures, so it never empties and holds no stop
condition. [`next-item`](#next-item) is the actionable queue: it drops the `no-lane` rows,
counts them in `skipped_no_lane`, ranks by `crap` descending, and reports `empty` once
nothing it ranks has work left. Read `flag` and `remedy` on an entry to tell which of its
rows the queue will hand you: `no-lane` never, `ok` never, anything else next. Both are
the verdict the run stored, and `next-item` judges `remedy` against the ceiling
`crapkit.toml` holds now. After a ceiling edit no run has scored yet, `next-item`'s
`remedy` decides: lower `target` and it can hand out a row this list calls `ok`; raise it
and a row this list calls `decompose` can leave the queue. The two
payloads on this page come from one run of one repo: `worklist` leads with `render` at
risk 3.5, `next-item` hands out `classify` at crap 46.6. Neither is wrong.

`risk = ccn * weight`, rounded to four decimals. On a repo whose commits share a timestamp
there is no range to weight against, so each commit counts once: every file weighs `1.0`,
the ranking is ccn order, and the hot promotion is off, because a top 10% of equal
weights would be every file.

### `--batches N`

`--batches` **adds** a `batches` key. Every other key stays, so a caller that reads `active`
or `stale` off a batched call still gets them.

```json
{
  "active": ["... unchanged ..."],
  "batches": [
    {
      "entries": [{"function": "render( rows , wide , totals , header )", "path": "calc/report.py", "...": "..."}],
      "files": ["calc/report.py"]
    },
    {
      "entries": [{"function": "classify( score , attempts , late , bonus )", "path": "calc/grade.py", "...": "..."}],
      "files": ["calc/grade.py"]
    }
  ],
  "...": "..."
}
```

At most N batches, sharing no file, with co-changing files kept in the same batch. One batch
per agent session: two sessions working different batches cannot collide in the same file.

The session that holds a batch briefs its own rows. Every entry carries `path` and
`function`, the two arguments `brief` takes. [`--batch N`](#--batch-n) is not the per-batch
form of that call: its N counts packets off the `crap`-ranked queue, and this split ranks by
`risk`, so its packets can pile into one of these batches and miss the rest.

---

## `verify`

The verdict, plus the receipt that says what produced it.

```
$ crapkit verify --json
```

```json
{
  "baseline_commit": "8c780bb18da329dfe039b55d14faa5a6dc9fcb50",

      "long_name": "pick( a , b , c )",
      "path": "app/m.py",
      "recorded": 10.75
    }
  ],
  "ratchet_sha256": "3d05caa586f1d6e63cfce21b70ac06dc31243f82c9ac3071398f67f463cafe2f",

  "run_id": 9,
  "schema": 1,
  "tool_versions": {"crapkit": "<version>", "lizard": "1.24.0"},
  "unmarked_over_target": 0
}
```

### Verdict

| Key | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `ok` | bool | The final verdict after allowed overrides and flake retests. It agrees with the stored run verdict and command exit. Remaining findings or an ungranted diff-coverage breach make it `false`. |
| `run_id` | int | The run this verify wrote. |
| `baseline_run`, `baseline_commit` | int, string | What it was measured against. |
| `commit` | string | The commit the verified tree is at. Equal to `baseline_commit` when you are verifying uncommitted work. |
| `changed_files` | int | Files in the diff being judged. |

### Findings

| Key | Shape | Fires exit |
|---|---|---|
| `gate_violations` | `{path, long_name, start, ccn, cov, crap, remedy, dirty, key_name}` | 6 |
| `ratchet_regressions` | `{path, long_name, recorded, fresh_crap, dirty}` | 7 |
| `new_failures` | array of `classname::name` test ids | 8 |
| `diff_uncovered_count` | int, and `diff_uncovered[]` of `{path, line}` | 9, only when `diff_uncovered_max` is set |
| `diff_uncovered_max` | int, or `null` when the repo set none | none itself; it is the ceiling `diff_uncovered_count` is judged against, so a reader of exit 9 can name it |
| `overridden` | gate-violation objects an `--override` exempted | none; the run passes |
| `forgiven_failures` | array of test ids the fresh run and the baseline both failed | none; the text form counts them on the OK line as `(N unchanged failures forgiven, first ID)` |
| `retried_passes` | array of new failures that passed their [flake retry](lanes.md#flake-retest) | none; the text form names them on the OK line as `(N new failures passed on rerun, first ID)` |
| `unmarked_over_target` | int: functions over their ceiling that carry no ratchet mark, the standing debt neither the gate (touched functions only) nor the ratchet check (marks only) guards | none; the text form prints one `warning: N function(s) over the ceiling carry no ratchet mark ...` line on stderr when it is not zero, naming `ratchet seed` as the fix |

`key_name` on a gate violation is the ratchet key: the `long_name` when one function in
the file holds that name, and `long_name#2` for the second function holding it. It is the
string to look up in `crapkit-ratchet.tsv`, and `long_name` alone is not, whenever a file
gives one name to several functions. `ratchet_regressions` carries the key in `long_name`
already, because the entry it reports comes from the marks file.

**`diff_uncovered` truncates at 50 entries; `diff_uncovered_count` does not.** Above 50 the
two disagree on purpose. Trust the count.

`verify` reports the first of 6, 7, 8, 9 that fires, in that order.

The run a verify stores keeps each lane's `failures` as the lane reported them, first attempt
included. A lane with failures that passed their flake retry also names those ids under
`retried_passes`. A later verify that reads this run as its baseline leaves them out, so it
never forgives them: the baseline did not count them as failing.

Since 0.4.5 the gate exempts a touched function whose fresh CRAP sits at or under its ratchet
mark, the rule `rescore --gate` already applied (#29). So a `gate_violations` entry on a
marked function means the edit pushed it past the mark, and one payload can carry that entry
and a `ratchet_regressions` entry for the same function. Exit 6 is the verdict there. Exit 7
is for a mark that rose in a function the diff never touched. Both rules are stated once in
[ratchet.md](ratchet.md#the-commit-gate-skips-marked-functions).

A `--baseline ID` naming a run that exists but cannot serve now says which run it is, why,
and which runs can (#27), instead of the empty-store line:

```
crapkit: run 5 is a failed verify and cannot serve as a baseline; trusted runs: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7; pass `--baseline 7` for the newest
crapkit: run 8 is an inventory run (no coverage was measured) and cannot serve as a baseline; trusted runs: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9; pass `--baseline 9` for the newest
crapkit: no run 99 in the store (`crapkit runs` lists them); trusted runs: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7
```

The reason is the run's own kind: a failed verify, a verify with no verdict, a hook run, a
partial run (a lane subset, or a lane that failed), an inventory run.

A lane that wrote no test counts this run gets one line naming the gap rather than a
KeyError (#30), and `inventory` no longer dies when a tracked file is missing from the
working tree.

### Dirty attribution

A verdict measures the working tree, so a concurrent session's uncommitted edits land in it.

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `dirty` (on each finding) | The finding's file has uncommitted tracked edits. |
| `committed_findings` | Gate, ratchet, test-failure and breached diff-coverage findings whose file is clean. |
| `dirty_findings` | Findings whose file is not. |
| `dirty_failures` | The subset of `new_failures` whose test id names a file with uncommitted edits. Both the repo-path form and pytest's dotted-module form are matched. |

CI should treat any non-zero finding count as a failure. A local pre-push check can
reasonably look at `committed_findings` alone.

### Receipt

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `tool_versions` | `{"crapkit": ..., "lizard": ...}`. The metric identity behind the numbers. |
| `ratchet_sha256` | Digest of the ratchet file as read. **`null` when the repo has no ratchet file.** Pin it to prove which marks a verdict was measured against. |
| `ratchet_changes` | `{"dropped": N, "tightened": M}` when this run's tighten rewrote the marks file: `dropped` counts marks whose function is now at or under its ceiling, `tightened` marks that fell. **`null` when the tighten wrote nothing**: a failed run, `--no-tighten`, no marks file, or nothing to move. An override's grant is its own write to the marks file and is listed under `overridden`, not counted here. The text form prints the same two counts on the OK line with the `git add` to run (`restamped` in place of the counts when the only change was the stamp line, `N marks granted` after an override). |

---

## `coverage`

The run summary: corpus size, the four flags counted, the grade, and provenance for every
lane that spoke.

```
$ crapkit coverage --json
```

```json
{
  "by_scope": {"calc": {"crap_load": 124.07, "functions": 3, "grade": "F", "over_target": 2}},
  "cache_hits": 2,

  "ceilings": {"default": 6},
  "commit": "9a1d11895c5ff5b791b497a13294494fdab949ce",
  "crap_load": 124.07,
  "db": "/repo/.crapkit/crap.sqlite",
  "files": 2,
  "functions": 3,
  "grade": "F",
  "kind": "coverage",
  "lane_failures": {},
  "lanes": {
    "py": {
      "artifact_sha256": "313ce0f1dcaa3d914622a28b3f9694df876bef194d27fc753176bef36c698cf1",
      "exit_code": 0,
      "parser": "coveragepy",
      "scopes": ["calc"]
    }
  },
  "measured": 2,
  "no_lane": 0,
  "over_target": 2,
  "run_id": 2,
  "schema": 1,
  "skipped_max_bytes": 0,
  "unmeasured_scopes": [],
  "untested": 1
}
```

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `run_id`, `commit`, `db` | The run written, its commit, and the absolute store path. |
| `files`, `functions` | Corpus size. |
| `cache_hits` | Files served from the content-hash analysis cache. |
| `skipped_max_bytes` | Files dropped by `[exclude] max_file_bytes`. |
| `measured`, `untested`, `no_lane`, `cc_only` | The four flags, counted. They sum to `functions`. |
| `over_target` | Functions whose `crap` exceeds their scope ceiling, counted over the measured scopes: on a `partial` run the scopes in `unmeasured_scopes` are left out, since a skipped lane's functions score at cov 0 and would read as this run's debt. On a full run that is every function. The key keeps its name; the ceiling is what the config's `target` sets. |
| `crap_load` | Sum of every function's CRAP, rounded to 2dp. |
| `grade` | The letter for over-ceiling density over the same functions `over_target` counts. `A+` only at exactly zero. |
| `by_scope` | Per scope: `{functions, over_target, crap_load, grade}`. |
| `lanes` | Provenance per lane that succeeded: `artifact_sha256`, the command's `exit_code` (`null` when the artifact was reused), `parser`, `scopes`, plus `results_artifact_sha256`, `failures`, `tests_total` and `tests_skipped` when the lane declares a `results_artifact`. The digests bind coverage and JUnit to the bytes read for this run. Under `--reuse-unchanged` each lane also carries `rerun_reason`: `""` when its artifact was reused, else the sentence its `rerunning:` stderr line gave, such as `the working tree has 1 uncommitted change(s): src/app.ts`. |
| `lane_failures` | Lane name to failure text, for lanes that produced no artifact, or one that reaches none of the paths their scopes declare: measured files outside this checkout (another tree), or absolute paths that resolve under it (this tree, spelled absolutely, which the root-relative join still matches nothing of). Non-empty means the run is typed `partial` and cannot be a baseline; `coverage` exits 5 only when every lane failed, and then the payload is the [error object](#errors). |
| `kind` | `coverage` for a full run, `partial` when a lane was skipped (`--lane`) or failed: the word `runs` lists it under. A partial run is never a baseline. |
| `unmeasured_scopes` | Scopes a declared lane measures that no succeeding lane reached this run, in declaration order; `[]` on a full run. A scope no lane declares at all is not listed: that is a configuration `doctor` names, not this run's shape. |
| `ceilings` | The ceilings in force: `default` (the `[crapkit] target`) and every scope whose own `target` differs from it, `{"default": 6, "reports": 12}`. Scopes at the default are not listed. |

`inventory --json` is the same run summary minus everything coverage adds: `run_id`,
`commit`, `files`, `functions`, `cache_hits`, `skipped_max_bytes`, `db`.

Coverage attribution uses line spans. When distinct functions share the same path,
start line and end line, an artifact that overlaps that span cannot distinguish their
coverage. Every function on such a span scores as `untested` with coverage 0, never the
number a neighbour's measurement carries, and the run continues. It names on stderr how
many spans it met, and the path and line of those holding a function its ceiling fails
at zero coverage, which splitting the definitions onto separate lines measures. Equal
coverage values do not remove the ambiguity. Copies of one function in several scopes
are not a collision. `cc-only`, `no-lane`, and functions with no matching artifact keep
their existing flags.

The plain form prints the same run on one line, zero buckets dropped and the ceiling
labelled, then the command to run next:

```
run 2 @ 9a1d11895c5: 3 functions scored: 2 measured / 1 untested, 2 over ceiling 6, CRAP load 124.07, grade F
-> next: crapkit worklist
```

With a scope at its own ceiling the label reads `over their ceilings (6; reports 12)`. A
partial run opens with `partial run (lane py; web unmeasured; not a baseline)`, a failed
lane named in it as `lane ui failed` and listed after the line as `  lane 'ui' FAILED: ...`,
counts `over` and the grade over the measured scopes only, and ends with `-> rerun changed
lanes: crapkit coverage --reuse-unchanged`. With uncommitted changes in the tree that line
adds ``(the working tree has uncommitted changes, so every lane that lists no `inputs`
reruns)``.

## `doctor --json`

The captured example below uses analysis version 8. A current `doctor` reports
version 11; read the field from the running tool when checking a ratchet stamp.

The only health payload crapkit exposes. It works on a repo that has never run anything.

```
$ crapkit doctor --json
```

```json
{
  "analysis_version": 8,
  "lanes": [
    {
      "artifact": ".crapkit/cov/py.json",
      "artifact_present": true,
      "commit": "9a1d11895c5ff5b791b497a13294494fdab949ce",
      "name": "py",
      "seconds": 1.1
    }
  ],
  "newest_run": {"id": 2, "kind": "coverage", "verdict_ok": null},
  "problems": [],
  "schema": 1,
  "store": {"path": ".crapkit/crap.sqlite", "present": true, "size_bytes": 40960},
  "versions": {"crapkit": "<version>", "lizard": "1.24.0", "python": "3.11.2"},
  "warnings": []
}
```

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `problems` | The FAIL findings, as text. **Non-empty is exit 1.** |
| `warnings` | The WARN findings: unmeasured directories, scopes a lane measures with no `scoped_tests` template, lanes writing their artifacts at the repo root instead of under `.crapkit/`, and lanes with no `results_artifact`. Exit stays 0. |
| `versions` | crapkit, lizard, python. `lizard` is `null` when it is not importable, which is also a FAIL. |
| `analysis_version` | The analysis semantics version, currently `11`. Together with `lizard` it forms the ratchet's metric stamp. Follow [the upgrade checks](upgrading.md#measure-before-changing-marks) before restamping; changed function identity can require a reviewed mapping. |
| `store` | `.crapkit/crap.sqlite`: whether it exists and how big it is. `present: false` and `size_bytes: 0` on a fresh repo. |
| `newest_run` | `{id, kind, verdict_ok}`, or `null` when nothing has run. `verdict_ok` is `null` for non-verify runs. |
| `lanes` | Per declared lane: `name`, `artifact`, whether the artifact is on disk now, and the `commit` and `seconds` from its stamp. `commit` and `seconds` are `null` for a lane that has never run here. |

`note`-level findings (a file over `max_file_bytes`, no lanes declared, a coverage.py lane
an environment manager heads and doctor therefore did not probe) appear in the plain output
only. They are neither problems nor warnings.

The `results_artifact` warning is new in 0.4.5 (#26), and it names the two checks the lane
loses rather than the key alone. A repo whose one lane declares neither the artifact nor a
`scoped_tests` template answers:

```json
["lane 'py' declares no results_artifact: the crashed-worker check and the no-new-failures check (exit 8) cannot run for it; add --junitxml=.crapkit/cov/junit-py.xml to the command and results_artifact = \".crapkit/cov/junit-py.xml\" to the lane",
 "scope 'calc' has a lane but no [crapkit.scoped_tests] template — `crapkit test-scoped` exits 3 on its files, so whoever edits them is handed no command to run their tests; add calc = \"<test command>\" under [crapkit.scoped_tests]"]
```

`crapkit init` writes `--junitxml` and `results_artifact` on the lanes it detects, so this
one fires on a config written by hand or by an older crapkit.

A lane whose first word will not start is a FAIL, not a warning: `doctor` reads the command
with the shell that will run it (sh on POSIX, cmd.exe on Windows), so a quoted interpreter
path is one word and a runner after `&&` is checked too. Each distinct runner is probed
once per `doctor` call rather than once per lane.

`doctor --tune` is a different command shape: it prints TOML lines, not JSON, and it
respects neither `--json` nor `--show-files`.

The additive `resources` object in ordinary `doctor --json` reports
`available_cpus`, `cpu_probe`, `requested_analysis_workers`, `shared_pool_limit`,
`pool_worker_limit`, `default_chunks_per_worker`, `default_source_bytes_per_worker`,
`inherited_analysis_workers`, `memory_budget_mb`, `worker_memory_estimate_mb`,
`memory_is_hard_limit`, `estimated_pool_memory_mb`, `budget_directory`,
`coordination` and `serial_fallback`. It also carries `log_max_bytes`.
`test_retention_days` and `test_retention_count` are deprecated and always `0`:
crapkit applies no test evidence retention, and its development runner takes
`--retention-days` and `--retention-count` instead. These fields describe the
effective policy, not sampled utilization. A memory budget is a pool-sizing
estimate, not an operating-system allocation limit.

The two automatic sizing fields describe the active multiprocessing start method:

| Field | Returned value | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `default_chunks_per_worker` | `4` for `spawn`, `1` otherwise | Chunks per worker used to calculate the automatic request, rounded up. |
| `default_source_bytes_per_worker` | `524288` for `spawn`, `null` otherwise | With `spawn`, source size can raise the request to one worker per 512 KiB, rounded up. |

Runnable chunks, CPU and configured ceilings, and free slots still cap the pool.
These fields report policy; they are not configuration keys or memory limits.

### `clean --json`

`clean --dry-run --json` previews temporary mutation recovery. Removing
`--dry-run` performs the eligible recoveries. The response has `schema: 1`,
`dry_run`, `test_runs` and `temporary_mutations`.

| Field | Shape |
|---|---|
| `test_runs` | Object with path arrays `removed`, `planned`, `active`, `unproven` and `changed`, always empty. `clean` applies no test evidence retention; crapkit's own development runner does, with `tools/testing/run.py --retention-days N --retention-count N`. The object stays so readers keep every key. |
| `temporary_mutations` | Array of `{path, status, reason}`. Status is `recovered`, `planned`, `active`, `unproven` or `failed`. A failed recovery exits 1. |

Active leases and unrecognized evidence are preserved.
Intentional mutation pools require the existing `mutate --drop-pool` command.

### `doctor --plugin-root PATH`


The plugin and the CLI ship as two artifacts with one version number between them, and
neither notices when they drift. This is the check, and it reads no repo at all.

It compares the plugin's `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` version against **the `crapkit` on
PATH**, and every `--protocol` in its `hooks/hooks.json` against the protocol `claude-hook`
answers. One line per disagreement, silence when they agree, exit 1 when it printed anything:

```
$ crapkit doctor --plugin-root crapkit
crapkit doctor: the plugin at crapkit is version 0.3.0, and the crapkit its hooks spawn (/usr/local/bin/crapkit) is <version>. Reinstall whichever is behind: `claude plugin install crapkit@crapkit`, or `pip install -U crapkit`.
crapkit doctor: the plugin at crapkit asks for hook protocol 2; this crapkit answers 1, so `claude-hook` exits 0 silent on every edit.
```

PATH's `crapkit`, not the module answering the question: `hooks/hooks.json` and `.mcp.json`
both spawn that bare name, so on a machine with a venv crapkit and an older pipx one the
check ran in the first and the hook started the second. The version comes off that
executable's own `--version`, and the line names which executable answered. When PATH
carries no `crapkit` at all, there is nothing to compare and nothing that can start:

```
$ crapkit doctor --plugin-root crapkit
crapkit doctor: FAIL no `crapkit` on PATH — the plugin's hooks/hooks.json and .mcp.json both spawn that bare name, so every PostToolUse edit fires a command that cannot start and the MCP server never comes up. Install it where the PATH the hook inherits can see it (`pipx install crapkit`), or point the plugin at the environment holding it.
```

Exit 1. A `pip install` into a project `.venv` is the usual way to land here: the console
script goes into that venv's `Scripts` and nothing else on the machine sees it.

A root doctor found rather than one you typed gets a `crapkit doctor: checking <that root>`
line first, naming the install the verdict is about: the search reaches three levels under
the directory you named, so a source checkout can win over an install and the two look the
same from the outside. A `PATH` that is itself a plugin root prints no such line, and
neither does a check that found nothing to say.

```
$ crapkit doctor --plugin-root plugin        # PATH is the plugin root: silent, exit 0

$ crapkit doctor --plugin-root .             # PATH is a directory above it
crapkit doctor: checking plugin
```

With no `PATH` at all it reads Claude Code's own plugin directory (`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, else
`~/.claude`), and when nothing is installed there it names the directory it looked in and
exits 1:

```
$ crapkit doctor --plugin-root
crapkit doctor: no installed crapkit plugin under ...\.claude\plugins (install with `claude plugin install crapkit@crapkit`, or pass --plugin-root PATH)
```

(The absolute path is elided; the line prints it in full.)

A plugin with no manifest gets one line saying so and no protocol check: there is no version
to compare, and the protocol line underneath would bury the fact that explains both. A plugin
shipping no `hooks/hooks.json` registers no advisory hook, and the output says that instead.
It prints no JSON and ignores `--json`.

`PATH` may be the plugin root itself or any directory above it: `~/.claude`, `~/.claude/plugins`,
the cache root `~/.claude/plugins/cache`, or a marketplace or plugin directory inside it. Claude
Code keeps an install at `cache/<marketplace>/<plugin>/<version>/` and leaves the old version
beside the new one after an update, so among the manifests named `crapkit` under `PATH` the
newest install is the one checked; the other plugins sharing that cache are never read. With no `PATH` at
all, doctor looks in Claude Code's plugin directory (`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, else `~/.claude`),
through `installed_plugins.json` and the cache, and names that directory when nothing is
installed there.

## `ratchet report --json`

How much debt is open, how much was repaid, and whether the configured policy is breached.

```json
{
  "anchor_ts": 1787230800,
  "dropped_last_30d": 0,
  "dropped_last_90d": 0,
  "dropped_total": 0,
  "oldest": [
    {"age_days": 0, "long_name": "classify( score , attempts , late , bonus )", "path": "calc/grade.py"},
    {"age_days": 0, "long_name": "render( rows , wide , totals , header )", "path": "calc/report.py"}
  ],
  "open": 2,
  "policy_violations": null,
  "schema": 1,
  "uncommitted": 0
}
```

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `open` | Marks open **on disk**, working tree included. A seed you have not committed counts. |
| `uncommitted` | Marks the working tree and the newest committed version disagree on: added, repaid or tightened but not committed. |
| `dropped_total`, `dropped_last_30d`, `dropped_last_90d` | Repayments, from committed history only. |
| `oldest` | Up to 20 open marks, oldest first, each with `age_days`. |
| `anchor_ts` | Unix seconds of the **newest commit** that touched the ratchet file. Every age and window is measured back from here, never from the wall clock, which is what makes the report deterministic on a fixed history. |
| `policy_violations` | `null` when no policy was evaluated, `[]` when it ran clean, otherwise the findings. See [ratchet.md](ratchet.md#the-debt-policy). |

---

## Other payloads

| Command | Shape |
|---|---|
| `runs --json` | `{"runs": [{id, kind, verdict_ok, findings, baseline, commit, lanes[], created_at}]}`. `kind` is `inventory`, `coverage`, `partial`, `verify`, `hook` or `legacy`. Only `coverage`, `legacy` and passing `verify` runs are baseline candidates. `verdict_ok` is `null` on a run that renders no verdict, which is every kind but `verify`. `findings` is how many a verify recorded. `baseline` is true on the one run `verify` compares against today, which is not always the newest candidate: see [the trusted baseline](../README.md#the-trusted-baseline). |
| `runs prune --json` | `{"pruned_runs": 6, "kept_runs": 4, "freed_bytes": 0}`. |
| `trend --json` | `{"runs": [{run_id, commit, created_at, functions, over_target, crap_load, avg, by_scope}], "target": 6}`, trusted runs only. Reads and fills the `run_rollup` cache; see below. |
| `overrides --json` | `{"overrides": [{run_id, commit, created_at, path, function, crap, reason}]}`. |
| `rescore --json` | `{"baseline_run", "baseline_commit", "functions": [{scope, path, function, start, end, occurrence, ccn, cov, flag, crap, remedy, stale_coverage}], "note"}`. Every row carries `stale_coverage: true`: the complexity is the working tree's, the coverage is the baseline run's. With `--gate` the payload adds `gate`: `{"ok", "judged", "ceilings": {path: ceiling}, "breaches": [{path, function, start, ccn, cov, crap, remedy, key_name, ceiling}], "untracked": [path]}`. `judged` counts the functions the working tree changed since HEAD (an untracked file in full), `breaches` the judged functions whose `ccn` is over their file's ceiling and that no ratchet mark pardons (a mark pardons only while the function's crap is at or under it), `ok` is `breaches == []`, and the exit is 6 when it is false. The text form prints `gate: 2 changed function(s) judged, 0 over ceiling 6` on stdout when the gate passes and the GATE lines on stderr when it does not. |
| `duplication --json` | `{"run_id", "pairs": [{similarity, contained, functions: [{path, long_name, start, end, nloc}, ...]}]}`. Containment scoring: shared shingles over the smaller function. A pair whose two spans nest in one file is dropped, not ranked: a factory and the closure defined inside it score 1.0 by construction and cannot be deduplicated. `contained` is therefore `false` on every pair here, and it is emitted so pairs and `duplication_twins` read as one shape. |
| `coupling --json` | `{"window_months", "pairs": [{files: [a, b], support, confidence}]}`. `support` is shared commits, `confidence` is the max-direction ratio. It reads raw `git log`, so any path in the history can appear, not only scoped source. Ranked pairs are cached; see below. |
| `mutate --json` | `{"mutants", "killed", "survived", "survivors": [{path, line, op, original, mutated}], "outside_corpus": [path]}`. `mutants` is the count **after** `--max-mutants`; the truncation warning goes to stderr only. `outside_corpus` lists the diff's paths (or `--files`' paths) the scored corpus does not hold, a test file, an excluded path, a file over `max_file_bytes` or a file no scope claims, sorted; they grew no mutants, and a run with `mutants` 0 and a non-empty `outside_corpus` never started the suite. Every worker uses a kept worktree, including one; see [mutation worktrees](configuration.md#mutation-worktrees). |
| `claims --json` | Above. |
| `digest` | **Never JSON.** Plain lines, and silent when nothing changed. |
| `report` | No payload of its own. It writes one self-contained HTML page to `.crapkit/report.html` (or `--out PATH`, repo-relative, or an absolute path you name) and prints that path on stdout, rendering the `worklist` and `trend` payloads above at their defaults. Read those two instead of parsing the page. |
| `explain` | Plain lines by default. `--json` emits the same content as one sorted-keys object with `schema` 1: the score per run, the ratchet mark, and under `--history` the commits that touched the function, each carrying its message `body` alongside its sha. `NAME` takes a start line as of 0.4.5, the same form `brief` takes. |

### Read commands that write

`trend` and `report` are still read commands to their caller, and since 0.4.5 they write to
the store. Both used to re-derive per-run totals from every scored row of every run, twice,
on every invocation: 4.3 M rows on the corpus the 0.4.5 work was measured against, 4.58 s per
`trend`. A run is immutable once written, so its totals are now summed once into a
`run_rollup` table and read back from there: `trend` 4.58 s to 0.04 s warm, `report` down
76%. A prune takes a run's rollup rows with it.

Two consequences for a caller.

- **The rollup write is best effort.** If another process holds the write lock or
  the cache cannot be written, the command still prints the calculated totals.
  Opening an older store can require a schema migration before this cache step.
- **The cache is keyed on the ceiling the totals were decided against**, repo target plus
  per-scope targets. Change a ceiling in `crapkit.toml` and the next `trend` refills under a
  new key rather than reporting the old numbers.

`run_collisions` follows the same pattern for the legacy mark proof. The first reader that
needs a run's same-line collision groups scans that run once and stores them: `worklist`,
`next-item`, `brief`, `verify`, `ratchet seed`, `ratchet prune`, `runs prune`, and the MCP
tools that read marks (`list_worklist`, `get_next_item`, `get_function_brief`). `explain`
and `rescore --gate` prove the few files they read off the path index and fill it only
when they prove more than 64 files. The write is best effort, like the rollup: a locked or
read-only store still answers from the scan. A prune takes a run's collision rows with it.

`brief` writes the run's shingle index, the digests `duplication_twins` is looked up in
(`twin_runs`, `twin_functions` and `twin_postings`). A brief on a run with no stored index
builds it from every scored file and stores it; every later brief, batched or not and in
any process, reads it back and opens only its own function's file. Storing one run's index
drops every older run's, and `runs prune` drops it with its run; on a large consumer repo
one index is 37.8 MB. The write is best effort too: a locked store answers from the index
it built.

### The coupling cache

`coupling`, `brief` and `worklist --batches` rank the same co-change pairs out of the same
window, and each one used to re-cut the churn log and re-count every combination on every
run. Since 0.4.5 the ranked pairs live in `.crapkit/coupling-cache-v1.json`, beside
`churn-cache-v2.json` and `churn-log-v2.z`. Warm `coupling` on the measured corpus went from
1.05 s to 0.11 s, `worklist --batches` down 62%, a single `brief` down 25%.

What is stored is the ranking at the **default** thresholds, in full order, uncut. `--top`
truncates that order, so it reads the cache. `--min-support` or `--min-confidence` off the
defaults ask a wider question than the file answers and recompute, because serving them a
filtered subset would drop the pairs those thresholds exist to surface.

The key is HEAD, the window, the UTC date, the path format and a digest of the tracked set,
the churn map's key plus that digest. The tracked set is in the key
because ranking drops any pair naming a file `git ls-files` no longer lists, and the index
moves without HEAD: `git rm --cached src/util.py` leaves the sha alone and must still retire
every pair naming that file. Unreadable or unkeyable content reads as cold, never as a crash.

The paths are decoded. git spells a non-ASCII name in a log with C-style escapes, and since
0.4.5 all three readers undo that before joining, so a pair names the file `git ls-files`
names rather than a spelling that joins to nothing.

---

## Errors

Under `--json`, a command that dies still prints one object on stdout, so a wrapper reads
the sentence that names the fix instead of an empty stream:

```json
{"error": {"exit": 5, "kind": "tool", "message": "every lane failed (2 of 2); the errors are above"}, "schema": 1}
```

| `exit` | `kind` | Raised when |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `state` | The store or the tree lacks what the command needs: no run, no scored run, no function matching the name, no open claim. |
| 3 | `config` | `crapkit.toml` is missing, does not parse, or refuses a value; an unknown `--lane` or `--scope` is this too. |
| 4 | `git` | A git command failed or a commit is missing: a baseline that is not an ancestor, a shallow clone. |
| 5 | `tool` | A lane or an external tool failed: every lane failed, an artifact the last attempt never wrote, lizard missing. |

`message` is the stderr line without its `crapkit: ` prefix; that line and the exit code
are unchanged. Verdict exits are not errors: `verify`'s 6 to 9 and `rescore --gate`'s 6
print their own payloads, with the verdict inside. Without `--json`, stdout stays empty
on an error.

---

## `claude-hook`

The one command on this page Claude Code runs for you, after every Edit or Write of a source
file, and after every Bash command wherever you register that matcher. It names functions that edit pushed over their ceiling, while the session can still act
on it.

```
crapkit claude-hook --protocol 1
```

**In:** one Claude Code PostToolUse event, as JSON on stdin. **Out:** nothing on stdout,
ever. Protocol 1 reserves stdout for a future JSON channel, and Claude Code parses stdout
JSON on exit 0. There is no `--repo`: the root is the first `crapkit.toml` above the edited
file. The plugin registers it async with a 20-second timeout, so no edit waits on it.

| Exit | Means | Output |
|---|---|---|
| `0` | nothing to say | stdout and stderr both empty |
| `2` | a changed function is over its ceiling | three or more lines on stderr, which reach the model |

Captured from a real run, on a file whose `route` reached ccn 7 under a ceiling of 6:

```
crapkit advisory: 1 function(s) over ceiling 6 in app/m.py (the edit landed; nothing was blocked)
  ccn 7  app/m.py:1  route( a , b , c , d )
the commit gate enforces this; decompose there or mark the debt
```

**It is advisory, and the wording says so.** PostToolUse runs after the write, so the edit is
already on disk and nothing can block it. `hook-precommit` stays the only enforcement point.
The head line states that outright, because the reader is a model holding a nonzero exit
code.

It judges the functions the edit touched, not the whole file. Judging the file would fire on
every edit in a repo with seeded debt and say nothing new. An untracked file is the one
exception: `git diff` can see none of it, so every function in it counts.

That diff runs root-relative since 0.4.5, the way every other git spawn crapkit makes does,
so a `crapkit.toml` below the git top gets advisories on the paths the commit gate will
judge.

A `Bash` event names no `file_path` — its `tool_input` carries the `command` — so it takes a
working-tree fallback instead: the `*.py` files git reports dirty or untracked, whose mtime
falls inside a **12-second** freshness window, at most **25** of them, each judged through
the same per-file ladder. Each breaching file gets its own advisory block, so one Bash event can print
several; the exit is 2 when any of them breached. That is what catches source written through a shell heredoc or
`python - <<'PY'`, which some harness modes use for every write.

Each bound has its own reason. The window keeps a later `ls` from re-advising a file that was
already dirty before this command ran. The cap is there because PostToolUse waits this
process out, so a large dirty tree would be a stall rather than a reason to judge all of it.
And only Python is judged, because every other language stays the commit gate's business,
which is what keeps the fallback cheap enough to pay per shell call. The status read is
`git status --porcelain -z -uall`, so a heredoc that creates a whole new directory of source
arrives as its files rather than as one collapsed `?? newdir/` row.

The shipped plugin registers `Edit|Write` only. A `Bash` matcher is the consumer's choice: a
second entry in your own settings hooks, same command, matcher `Bash`.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {"type": "command", "command": "crapkit claude-hook --protocol 1", "timeout": 20}
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

It costs one `git rev-parse` and one `git status` per shell call in any git repo, measured or
not, which is why it is not the default. Add it when the harness writes source through the
shell; skip it when every write arrives as an `Edit`.

### The silence ladder

Five rungs, each exiting 0 with both streams empty. Any uncaught exception does the same.

| Rung | Silent when |
|---|---|
| protocol | `--protocol` is anything but `1` |
| event | stdin is not one JSON object, or not a `PostToolUse` carrying `tool_input.file_path` or a `tool_input.command` |
| repo | no `crapkit.toml` above the edited file; the walk up stops at any `.git` entry, so a worktree never borrows its parent's config. On a `Bash` event: no git repo above the command's `cwd`, or no changed `*.py` fresh enough to judge |
| git state | mid-rebase, mid-merge or mid-cherry-pick |
| verdict | no scope claims the file, the source parses to no functions, no changed function is over the ceiling, or every one that is carries a ratchet mark |

Since 0.4.7 the protocol rung is checked first, ahead of the event shape and ahead of every
git call, so a payload for a protocol this CLI does not answer costs nothing but the read of
stdin. No outcome moved with it. The payload is read before any rung, which is why stdin
that is not one JSON object sits on the event row.

Silence is the design. PostToolUse renders every nonzero exit but 2 invisible, and 47.5% of
the edits this was measured against land in repos with no `crapkit.toml`. A hook that fired
there would be either useless or unbearable.

The mark exemption is existence, not the numeric rule `verify` applies: the store is never
opened, so the hook holds no CRAP to compare. Same rule as the commit gate, described in
[ratchet.md](ratchet.md#the-commit-gate-skips-marked-functions).

An unknown `claude-*` subcommand exits 0 silently too, so a plugin newer than the installed
CLI degrades to silence instead of an argparse usage dump on every edit.

---

## MCP server

The server reads cancellation and control messages while a tool is running.
Each connection admits one active tool call. An overlapping tool call returns
`isError: true` with a message to retry after the active call finishes.
Cancelling a request stops its owned CLI descendants. Closing stdin ends the
session and stops active work, so clients must keep stdin open until they have
read the replies they need. See [resource policies](resources.md) for process
ownership, pool limits and cleanup scope.

crapkit mcp
```

A dependency-free stdio MCP server: JSON-RPC 2.0, one message per line. The handshake
negotiates the protocol revision: a client's offer of `2025-06-18`, `2025-03-26` or
`2024-11-05` is spoken verbatim, and anything else gets `2025-06-18`, the newest this
server implements. Read-only, and declared so: every tool carries `readOnlyHint`,
`idempotentHint` and `destructiveHint: false` annotations, a `title` and an `outputSchema`
whose fields are described one by one, `initialize` returns `instructions` naming the
two-command prerequisite and the four tools a session starts with, and a tool whose text
is a JSON object also carries it parsed as `structuredContent`. Every tool shells to the CLI's own surface, so the MCP
view cannot drift from what the CLI reports, and nothing here writes a baseline, a
ratchet, or a mutant.

The CLI child stream is UTF-8, including non-ASCII filenames and error messages,
on Windows and POSIX. Tool calls can populate disposable caches, open or migrate
the snapshot store, and fill best-effort rollups. Read-only annotations describe
the measurement and debt operations exposed, not a promise of zero filesystem
writes. `get_next_item` takes no claim; `check_gate` runs `rescore` and records no
verification run.

Answering those calls from one long-lived process instead was measured for 0.4.5 and
rejected. A kept process serves a `source` the session has already edited, and a packet whose
`source` is stale is a packet nobody can edit from.

With no `--repo`, the server serves the nearest `crapkit.toml` at or above the directory the
client started it in ([ADR 0002](adr/0002-configuration-is-found-upward-nearest-wins.md)),
so a globally registered server started in a monorepo workspace serves the root
configuration that claims the workspace; a tool's `repo` argument is walked the same way,
and a `.git` entry without a configuration stops the walk. A given `--repo` names an exact
root, as on every subcommand, and each tool's command runs at the root the server found, so
`path` stays repo-relative wherever the server was started. In a directory with no
`crapkit.toml` at or above it the server still starts and answers `initialize` and
`tools/list`. Each `tools/call` there comes
back as a tool result, not a JSON-RPC error, and that result carries `isError: true` with
text naming the missing config and `crapkit init`:

```json
{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 3, "result": {"content": [{"type": "text", "text": "no crapkit.toml in .../noconfig - nothing measured here. Run `crapkit init` in the repo you want scored, or pass this tool a `repo` argument (or start the server with --repo) pointing at one."}], "isError": true}}
```

Both halves are deliberate. The result keeps the client's session alive, so a global
registration never turns into a dead server in unmeasured repos. `isError` stays true so
nothing reads an unmeasured directory as a repo with nothing to report.

Client wiring:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "crapkit": {
      "command": "crapkit",
      "args": ["mcp", "--repo", "/absolute/path/to/your/repo"]
    }
  }
}
```

Every tool also accepts a `repo` argument that overrides the server's default, so one server
can serve several checkouts.

| Tool | Arguments | Returns |
|---|---|---|
| `list_worklist` | `top` (int), `scope` (array of strings: one declared scope name per element, each becoming its own `--scope`) | JSON text |
| `list_runs` | | JSON text |
| `get_trend` | | JSON text (`trend --json`: per-run totals, oldest first) |
| `get_function_brief` | `path`, `name` | JSON text |
| `list_coupled_files` | `min_support`, `min_confidence` | JSON text |
| `list_duplicate_functions` | `similarity` | JSON text |
| `get_ratchet_report` | | JSON text |
| `list_claims` | | JSON text (`claims list --json`: the open claims) |
| `get_function_history` | `path`, `name`, `history` (bool: adds `commits` per function, the CLI's `--history`), `tests` (bool: adds `tests`, the CLI's `--tests`) | JSON text |
| `check_config` | | JSON text (the `doctor --json` report) |
| `get_next_item` | `top` (int), `exclude` (array of strings: one fragment per element, each becoming its own `--exclude`), `scope` (array of strings, as on `list_worklist`) | JSON text |
| `check_gate` | `path` (repo-relative source file, or absolute inside the repo; outside the repo or missing is a config error, and an unchanged or unscoped file judges 0) | JSON text: `rescore PATH --gate --json`, whose `gate` block says whether the edited file clears `rescore --gate`'s rule (`ok`, `judged`, `ceilings`, `breaches`, `untracked`). A ratchet mark pardons a changed function only while its crap sits at or under the mark, which is stricter than the pre-commit hook, where any mark pardons; the marks file is read only when a changed function breached, so a clean gate never reports a marks file it cannot parse. A breach exits 6 and answers as a result with `gate.ok` false, not a tool error |

Results arrive as MCP text content, and every tool's text is the payload of the CLI's
`--json` form: parse it, or read `structuredContent`, which carries the same object parsed
whenever the call exited 0. `isError` is true whenever the underlying CLI call exited
non-zero, and then the text is what the CLI printed: for `doctor` that is still the JSON
report (it exits 1 on any FAIL, so a failing `doctor` answers JSON text with `isError: true`
and no `structuredContent`); for the other `--json` tools it is the [error object](#errors)
the CLI prints, `{"error": {"exit", "kind", "message"}, "schema": 1}`, whose `message` is
the stderr line; `get_next_item`, which has no `--json` flag, answers the stderr line itself.
`check_gate` is the one exception to the exit rule: its exit 6 is the verdict, so a breach answers
`isError: false` with `structuredContent` attached and `gate.ok` false, while exits 3, 4 and 5
(and 1, no scored run yet) stay tool errors. `isError` is also
true in the cases where no CLI call runs at all: the missing-config result above, an
unknown tool name, and an argument the tool's own table refuses.

Arguments are checked against the served schema before anything is spawned. `tools/list`
declares `required` from each tool's positionals (`get_function_brief` and
`get_function_history` require `path` and `name`). A missing positional answers
`get_function_brief needs name (see inputSchema.required)`, an undeclared key answers
`list_worklist does not take 'bogus'; accepted: repo, top, scope`, and a wrong type answers
`top must be an integer (got "three")`. The refusal names the MCP tool and the argument
as the schema spells them, never the CLI command behind the tool. Each is a tool result with
`isError: true` in the tool's own vocabulary, not the protocol's `-32602` error, following
the precedent the missing-config answer set; the reason is recorded in
[ADR 0001](adr/0001-mcp-invalid-arguments-are-tool-results.md). Protocol errors stay
reserved for the protocol: an unknown method answers `-32601`, and an exception escaping
the server answers `-32603` and the loop reads on, so no single call ends the session.
`ping` answers an empty result, so a client's keepalive never reads as an error.

## Docker

The Dockerfile at the repository root builds the same stdio server as an image, which is
what a client or a registry that starts servers from a Dockerfile needs rather than from
an installed package.

```
docker build -t crapkit .
docker run -i --rm -v "$PWD:/repo" -w /repo crapkit
```

`-i` is the transport, not a convenience: with stdin closed the server reads EOF and exits
before `initialize`. The mount is the checkout being scored. The image serves `/repo`, so a
repo mounted anywhere else needs `--repo` on the command line, and an unmounted container
answers each `tools/call` with the missing-config result above. The image carries git,
because every tool shells to the CLI and the CLI reads git, and it serves as an
unprivileged account.
