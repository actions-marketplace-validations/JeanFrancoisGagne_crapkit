# crapkit.toml

`crapkit.toml` defines the project root, scopes and measurement commands. That root
can sit below the Git repository's top directory. `crapkit init` writes a starter;
this page lists every key. Use [Adoption](adoption.md) to choose the initial scope
and test layout, and [Coverage lanes](lanes.md) for runner recipes.

Five dials carry almost every decision you will make. Everything else has a default you can
leave alone:

| Dial | Key | Decides |
|---|---|---|
| the ceiling | `[crapkit] target` | what counts as too complex, repo-wide or per scope |
| the floor | `[crapkit] worklist_floor` | how small a function has to be before the queue ignores it |
| what is scored at all | `[exclude] globs` | which files leave the corpus for good |
| what is measured | `[[lane]]` | which command produces coverage, and for which scopes |
| what an agent runs | `[crapkit.scoped_tests]` | the test command a packet hands back at step 4 of the loop |

Four tables hold them: `[crapkit]`, `[[scope]]`, `[[lane]]`, `[exclude]`.

[crapkit.schema.json](../crapkit.schema.json) is the machine authority, and
`crapkit doctor` rejects any key not on it:

```
$ crapkit doctor
FAIL unknown key crapkit.churn_windo_months — crapkit ignores it (typo?); [crapkit] accepts these keys: alert_command, analysis_worker_budget, analysis_workers, churn_window_months, debt_max_age_months, diff_uncovered_max, log_max_bytes, max_parallel_lanes, mutation_command, mutation_timeout_seconds, mutation_workers, notes, ratchet_file, repayment_min_per_30d, scoped_tests, target, test_retention_count, test_retention_days, tighten_max_jump, worklist_floor, worklist_top
doctor: 1 problem(s)
```

The loader stays lenient so a config survives version skew: it ignores an unknown key at load
time, and only `doctor` fails on it. Every rejection the loader *does* make (a bad language,
an unknown parser, a lane naming an undeclared scope, a negative `timeout_seconds`) exits 3.

## File paths and root discovery

Without `--repo`, CLI commands find the nearest `crapkit.toml` at or above the
current directory. A `.git` entry stops the search. With `--repo PATH`, that path
names the exact project root; the flag belongs after the subcommand.

| File argument | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Relative path with a discovered root | Relative to the current directory, then rebased to the project root. |
| Relative path with explicit `--repo` | Relative to the named project root. |
| Absolute source path | Accepted when it resolves inside the project root. |
| Windows backslash | A directory separator on Windows; a literal filename character on POSIX. |

These rules apply to source arguments such as `brief`, `rescore`, `test-scoped`
and `claims release`. The `claude-hook` exception gets its root from its input
payload. [MCP tools](agent-json.md#mcp-server) take project-relative paths because
their CLI calls run at the server's selected root.

Tracked Git paths preserve whitespace and Unicode separators. Their bytes must
decode as UTF-8; invalid filename bytes are refused. Scope-prefix normalization
below applies to configuration strings, not to the filenames Git reports.
Output flags such as `--export`, `--sarif` and `--emit-baseline` are project-relative;
an absolute output path explicitly selects a destination outside it.

Parsed source diffs use Crapkit's own Git settings. Display preferences, external
diff commands and textconv do not change attribution. A supported source file
marked binary by Git attributes receives a text fallback; ordinary binary files
remain outside source decoding. Source text is read as UTF-8, then cp1252 as a
fallback. UTF-16 source is outside that reader policy.

## `[crapkit]`

| Key | Type | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| `target` | int >= 1 | `6` | The repo-wide CRAP ceiling. A `[[scope]]` may override it. Drives the gate, the `remedy` column, the ratchet drop threshold and every over-target count. |
| `churn_window_months` | int >= 1 | `12` | How far back `git log` is read for churn weighting, coupling and the worklist rank. |
| `worklist_floor` | int >= 1 | `5` | Minimum ccn for queue admission, in `worklist` and `next-item` alike. Printed in the worklist header as `floor ccn>=5`. It has no CLI flag. Two rules reach under it: files whose churn weight is in the top 10% are promoted down to ccn 3, and a function scoring over its ceiling is admitted whatever its ccn. |
| `worklist_top` | int >= 1 | `50` | Cap on the worklist active list. `worklist --top N` overrides it per call. |
| `ratchet_file` | string | `"crapkit-ratchet.tsv"` | The committed marks file, repo-relative. |
| `alert_command` | string | `""` | A shell command that receives a digest or override body on **stdin**. `digest --alert` uses it, and an override refuses to grant without it. Never interpolated into the shell string. |
| `scoped_tests` | table | none | Written as its own table, `[crapkit.scoped_tests]`, mapping scope name to a command template. `test-scoped` fills `{files}` with the quoted file list; a template with no `{files}` runs as written, which is how a scope runs its whole suite when its tests live outside its own `paths`. `init` picks the form per scope from the tracked files: `{files}` only where the scope's own paths hold a test file; the whole-suite form otherwise, naming the repo's test directory unless pytest's `testpaths` already collects it; `npm run test -w <dir>` for an npm workspace with a test script; and the runner's related-tests mode (`npx vitest related --run {files}`, `npx jest --findRelatedTests {files}`) for a root JavaScript scope, keyed by what package.json names. One comment line above each entry says which form it chose. It is also step 4 of the burn-down loop and `brief`'s `commands.scoped_tests`, so **doctor warns** about a scope a lane measures with no template behind it (`null` there leaves a session with nothing to run between the gate and verify) and **doctor fails** a `{files}` template on a scope that holds no test file, since that template hands the runner a source path and collects nothing. |
| `notes` | array of string | `[]` | House rules for this repo, in the config rather than in a file an agent has to find. `brief` carries them into the packet as `notes`, repo-wide lines first, then the scope's own. crapkit never parses them. |
| `mutation_command` | string | `""` | The suite run once per mutant. A nonzero exit means the mutant was killed, so the command is also run **once against the unmutated tree** before the first mutant and must exit 0 there: without that baseline a command that cannot start here killed every mutant and scored 100%. `mutate` refuses to run without it. Shell and PowerShell files in the diff are skipped and named on stderr: `<` and `>` are redirections in both, so their mutants would be noise. So is every file outside the scored corpus (a test file, an excluded path, a file over `max_file_bytes`, a file no scope claims): `mutate` never mutates a test, and a diff with nothing left says `nothing to mutate` at exit 0 without running the command. |
| `mutation_timeout_seconds` | int >= 1 | `300` | Per-mutant timeout. Expiry counts as killed, and the kill takes the suite's whole process tree, so a looping mutant does not outlive the run that gave up on it. At the default cap of 100 mutants this bounds one `mutate` run at over 8 hours, so lower it for a slow suite. |
| `mutation_workers` | int >= 1 | `1` | Mutants run at once. Every worker uses a kept detached Git worktree, including one. See [mutation worktrees](#mutation-worktrees) for preparation, concurrent runs and cleanup. |
| `diff_uncovered_max` | int >= 0 | absent | Ceiling on changed lines that never ran. **Absent means warn only**: `verify` still prints `warning: N changed line(s) have no coverage` on stderr and lists the first 20, but exits 0. Set it and a breach exits 9. |
| `debt_max_age_months` | int >= 0 | absent | `ratchet report --enforce` flags open marks older than this (counted at 30 days per month). |
| `repayment_min_per_30d` | int >= 0 | absent | `ratchet report --enforce` flags a burn-down that repaid fewer marks than this in the last 30 days while debt is open. |
| `max_parallel_lanes` | int >= 1 | `1` | Lanes running at once. `1` is strictly serial. See [lanes.md](lanes.md#running-lanes-in-parallel). |
| `analysis_workers` | int >= 0 | `0` | Requested analysis pool ceiling. `0` sizes pools automatically to balance startup cost and available work, within the process-visible CPU limit. Small or cached passes remain serial. Runnable chunks and the shared budget can admit fewer workers. |
| `analysis_worker_budget` | int >= 0 | `0` | Shared pool slot ceiling for Crapkit processes running as the same user on this host. `0` uses available CPUs. Admission never waits: a busy pool gives up slots, falling back to the calling process when none are free. See [resource policies](resources.md). |
| `log_max_bytes` | int >= 0 | `16777216` | Maximum bytes in each current and previous lane log, 16 MiB by default. Rotation keeps recent output and preserves no-progress accounting. `0` retains unlimited direct logs. |
| `test_retention_days` | int >= 0 | `7` | Remove recognized, idle default test-run evidence older than this many days. `0` disables age pruning. Explicit `--output` directories remain caller-managed. |
| `test_retention_count` | int >= 0 | `10` | Keep this many recent recognized default test runs. `0` disables count pruning. A run expires when either enabled limit is exceeded; active runs are preserved. |
| `tighten_max_jump` | number >= 1 | `2.0` | How far a function's CRAP may move between two runs of the **same commit** and still tighten its mark. Past this factor, `verify` holds the mark and prints one `NO TIGHTEN` line on stderr naming the function and both values. One commit measured twice cannot have improved, so a jump that size is the measurement talking, not the code. See [ratchet.md](ratchet.md#damping-a-measurement-that-bounces). |

### Mutation worktrees

Every mutation worker runs in a detached Git worktree, including the default of one.
Crapkit re-prepares each worker at the current HEAD, then replays dirty, untracked
and deleted inputs before running the unmutated baseline and the mutants.

The kept pool lives at `.crapkit/mutate-pool/w0..wN` and remains between runs.
On reuse, Crapkit removes surplus worker directories under the pool's exclusive
lease, so reducing `mutation_workers` also reduces retained checkouts.
`crapkit mutate --drop-pool` removes the kept pool and exits.

A concurrent run that finds the pool locked uses private worktrees under
`.crapkit/mutate-tmp` and removes them when finished. Each new temporary run
records its repository identity and holds a stable operating-system lease.
Startup recovery and `crapkit clean` remove only recognized, abandoned runs;
active or unproved paths stay intact. Old system-temp checkouts from releases
before 0.7.1 lack that ownership proof and are not removed automatically.
Results retain mutant order at every worker count.

Mutation refuses symlink or Windows reparse components in captured inputs and
worker paths. Worker writes also refuse files with multiple hard links, including
a path the suite replaced before restoration. Use private regular files for
mutation inputs. Commands finish only after their owned descendants stop; see
[command cleanup](lanes.md#the-kill-takes-the-whole-process-tree) for platform scope.

### The debt policy

`--enforce` is inert unless at least one of `debt_max_age_months` and
`repayment_min_per_30d` is set. With neither, `ratchet report --json` reports
`"policy_violations": null` and the flag can never fire. See
[ratchet.md](ratchet.md#the-debt-policy).

---

## `[[scope]]`

An array of tables. One scope per group of directories that share a ceiling and a set of
languages. Every tracked source file in a declared language must belong to a scope, or
`doctor` fails with `N tracked file(s) match a scope language but no scope path`.

Use `paths = ["."]` to claim the repo root, including loose source files. A deeper
declared path takes precedence over this root scope. Language and exclude rules
still apply.

| Key | Type | Required | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `name` | string | yes | | The scope's id. Lanes reference it, `--scope` filters on it (exact, not substring; a name no scope declares is a configuration error, exit 3, naming the declared scopes). |
| `paths` | array of string, min 1 | yes | | Repo-relative path prefixes the scope claims. A bare path also matches that exact file, so `paths = ["core/hot.py"]` claims one file and editing it marks that scope's lane changed. The **deepest** declared path wins when two claim the same file; see [Scope matching](#scope-matching). Written the way git writes one: a leading `./`, a leading or trailing `/` and a `\` separator are all normalized away, so `./src`, `src\` and `src` are one path. A path holding `..` or a drive letter is refused, because no tracked file can match it. |
| `languages` | array, min 1 | yes | | One or more of `typescript`, `tsx`, `javascript`, `python`, `swift`, `go`, `rust`, `shell`, `powershell`, `cpp`, `objectivec`, `vue`, `java`, `zig`. A file joins the scope only when both its path prefix and its extension match. |
| `target` | int >= 1 | no | the repo `target` | This scope's ceiling. One repo, different ceilings: strict on new code, tolerant on a legacy tree. |
| `coverage_optional` | bool | no | `false` | Code no test can reach, or code no parser can measure. See below. |
| `notes` | array of string | no | `[]` | House rules for this scope alone. They follow the repo-wide `[crapkit] notes` into every packet `brief` builds for a function this scope owns. |

Fourteen languages, two coverage parsers. A lane's `parser` is `coveragepy` or `istanbul` and
nothing else, so a lane can measure a scope only when its runner writes coverage.py's JSON
report or istanbul's `coverage-final.json`. In practice that means Python and the
JavaScript/TypeScript family. A scope whose runner writes neither scores complexity alone and
declares `coverage_optional = true`. See
[lanes.md](lanes.md#which-languages-a-lane-can-measure).

Extensions per language:

| Language | Extensions |
|---|---|
| `typescript` | `.ts` |
| `tsx` | `.tsx` |
| `javascript` | `.js`, `.jsx`, `.mjs`, `.cjs` |
| `python` | `.py` |
| `swift` | `.swift` |
| `go` | `.go` |
| `rust` | `.rs` |
| `shell` | `.sh`, `.bash` |
| `powershell` | `.ps1`, `.psm1` |
| `cpp` | `.c`, `.cc`, `.cpp`, `.cxx`, `.h`, `.hpp` |
| `objectivec` | `.m`, `.mm` |
| `vue` | `.vue` |
| `java` | `.java` |
| `zig` | `.zig` |

### Per-language gotchas

Read the ones you are about to point a scope at. Skip the rest.

**`shell` and `powershell` report functions only.** Statements outside any function land in
lizard's `*global*` pseudo-function, exactly like Python module-level code. A script that is
one long top-level sequence reports nothing. That is the answer, not a parse failure.

**`powershell` counts one point per `switch` arm**, the way `case` is counted in C, and
`default` is free. Its keywords are matched case-sensitively as written, so `If (` in code
counts nothing.

**Pester test files need a glob of your own.** Pester names them `Foo.Tests.ps1`, beside the
source they test, and no default exclude claims that spelling. `**/*.test.*` does not match
`.Tests.ps1`, and crapkit will not invent a glob that deletes production files from repos
naming scripts that way. One line does it:

```toml
[exclude]
globs = ["**/*.Tests.ps1"]
```

One form is enough: a leading `**/` [matches zero or more directories](#exclude), so the
glob reaches a repo-root `Deploy.Tests.ps1` as well as `scripts/Deploy.Tests.ps1`.
PowerShell repos keep scripts at the root more often than most, which is why that matters.

**`cpp` is the whole C family, C included.** There is no separate `c` label. lizard resolves
all six suffixes to one reader, so two labels could never measure differently, and `.h` is
the header both dialects share. `.hh`, `.hxx` and `.ipp` are not claimed: no lizard reader
declares them, and lizard serves an undeclared suffix from a silent fallback rather than from
a mapping.

Two more things before you point a scope at C code:

- Both arms of an `#ifdef` fork are textually present, so a platform shim defines the same
  function twice in one file. Each arm takes its own ratchet key — the first as written,
  later ones suffixed `#2`, `#3` in file order — so both are marked and both are gated.
  `analyze` prints one stderr line naming any file this happens in. See
  [Twins](ratchet.md#twins-one-name-several-functions).
- A `&&` before a function's opening brace declares an rvalue reference, not a decision, and
  costs no cognitive complexity. The rule covers `objectivec` too, because `.mm` is
  Objective-C++ and carries C++ move semantics. A `&&` inside a default argument is the one
  case it reads wrong; lizard's cyclomatic column drops the whole parameter list anyway, so
  the two columns agree about it.

**`vue` scores the `<script>` block.** Template directives (`v-if`, `v-else-if`, `v-for`) are
HTML attributes to lizard and contribute nothing, so a component whose branching lives in its
template reports only what its methods do.

**`zig` reads one point high on `switch`.** It counts the `else` prong as one more case. The
error is inflation only: it can cost a refactor that was not needed, never hide one that was.

**`rust`, `shell` and `powershell` run on crapkit's own readers.** lizard has neither a shell
nor a PowerShell reader, and its Rust reader scores a 7-arm `match` as ccn 2 (filed upstream
as lizard #494), so crapkit counts each non-wildcard arm the way C counts a `case`. The Rust
module retires itself the day upstream fixes it.

The cognitive column charges a Rust `match` like a `switch`: +1 plus the nesting it sits
in, arms free. The two columns therefore say different things about one block on purpose.
The 7-arm match above is ccn 7 and cognitive 1: seven ways through it, one decision to
read. The rule is Rust's alone, because `match` is a soft keyword in Python and an
ordinary identifier anywhere else.

### Scope matching

**The deepest declared path wins.** Paths are tried longest first, and the first whose path
prefix **and** extension both match owns the file. Declaration order breaks a tie between
two paths of the same length and decides nothing else. A prefix-only match does not stop the
search, so two scopes sharing a prefix but declaring different languages do not black-hole
each other's files.

Depth is a property of the path, not the scope, so a scope declaring both `src` and
`packages/web/src` claims a file under each at its own depth.

Declaring `src` first and `src/hot` second, `src/hot` still gets its file:

```
$ crapkit doctor
ok   config keys all recognized
ok   scope 'src': 1 file
ok   scope 'hot': 1 file
ok   every tracked source file belongs to a scope
```

The scored corpus, `test-scoped`, lane reuse and `brief` share this ownership rule.
After changing nested scopes, run `crapkit doctor --show-files` and check the
per-scope file lists before measuring them.

### `coverage_optional = true`

Two reasons to set it. Either no test can reach the code (entry points, deploy scripts,
generated shims), or nothing produces a coverage artifact crapkit reads for it (Go, Rust,
Swift, C and the rest).

`crapkit init` writes the key for the second reason on its own: a scope whose languages
all lack a parser gets it, a scope holding one language a parser reads does not. The first
reason is yours to declare, because only you know a test cannot reach the code.

Four effects:

- crapkit flags every function in the scope `cc-only` and scores it `crap = ccn`, skipping
  the formula. Feeding them `cov = 0` would say `add-tests` about code no test can reach.
- `remedy` narrows to `ok` or `decompose`.
- The scope needs no lane. Without this key, a lane-less scope is a `doctor` FAIL.
- doctor's unmeasured-directory check skips the scope.

```
$ crapkit rescore scripts/deploy.py --json
{"functions": [{"ccn": 5, "cov": 0.0, "crap": 5.0, "flag": "cc-only", "remedy": "ok", ...}], ...}
```

## `[[lane]]`

An array of tables. One lane per coverage command. Full recipes in [lanes.md](lanes.md).

| Key | Type | Required | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `name` | string | yes | | The lane's id. Names its log at `.crapkit/lane-<name>.log` and `coverage --lane`. |
| `command` | string | yes | | Run through the shell, cwd at the repo root unless `cwd` says otherwise. Its exit code is recorded, not enforced: a suite with known failures still writes a valid artifact. crapkit reads it with the shell that will run it, sh on POSIX and cmd.exe on Windows, and so does `doctor`. That reading covers quoting, carets, `&&` segments, redirections and `;`: [How a lane command is read](lanes.md#how-a-lane-command-is-read). |
| `artifact` | string | yes | | Repo-relative path to the coverage file the command writes. Its absence after the command (and its retries) is the failure. Two lanes may not share an artifact path. Point it under `.crapkit/cov/`, which `init` already gitignores; `doctor` warns about a lane writing at the repo root. See [Where artifacts live](lanes.md#where-artifacts-live). |
| `parser` | `istanbul` \| `coveragepy` | yes | | How to read the artifact. |
| `scopes` | array of string | yes | | Which scopes this lane's coverage speaks for. A scope in no lane's list can only score `no-lane`. |
| `cwd` | string | no | repo root | Repo-relative working directory for the command. `doctor` fails when it does not exist. |
| `path_prefix` | string | no | `""` | Prefix joined onto coverage.py's relative paths, for a suite run from a subdirectory. A coveragepy key: the istanbul reader never reads it. It only ever prepends, so it cannot rebase a path the runner wrote absolutely, which is the runner's own switch instead ([The same tree, spelled absolutely](lanes.md#the-same-tree-spelled-absolutely)). |
| `env` | table of string | no | `{}` | Extra environment for the command, merged over the inherited environment. Use it to cap a runner that sizes its own worker pool from free memory, and to hand a junit reporter its output path when the reporter reads no path off the command line (`jest-junit` is one). Every lane gets it, so raising `max_parallel_lanes` without one lets N lanes each claim the whole box. A `PATH` here **replaces** the inherited one for that lane, and `doctor` looks for the lane's runner on it, so a lane that ships its own toolchain is checked the way it runs. |
| `full_suite` | bool | no | `true` | `false` permits a positional argument in a pytest coverage command. At `true`, a positional is a config error: subset coverage under a suite with cross-file pollution is run-order dependent. A flag's value is not a positional (`-n 8`, `-o timeout=300`, `-p no:randomly` all pass), and the command is read by the shell that will run it, one argv per `&&`, `\|\|`, `&` or `\|` segment, with every segment that runs pytest checked. On cmd.exe a `;` starts nothing, so `pytest --cov; echo done` hands pytest `echo` and is refused; write the second command after `&&`. Use double quotes for values, since cmd.exe does not treat `'` as a quote. Set it false deliberately for a genuinely scoped suite. |
| `container_ok` | bool | no | `false` | Lets a `coveragepy` lane run inside a container. Without it such a lane refuses with exit 5 whenever `/.dockerenv` exists or `CRAPKIT_INSIDE_CONTAINER=1`. |
| `results_artifact` | string | no | `""` | A JUnit XML report, under `.crapkit/cov/` for the same reason as `artifact`. Two checks read it and neither runs without it: no-new-failures (`verify` exit 8) and the crashed-worker trust check, plus the suite-shrink warning. `doctor` WARNs on a `coveragepy` or `istanbul` lane that declares none, naming both, and `crapkit init` writes it on the lanes it detects. Declared but missing is exit 5, so the check can never pass vacuously, and so is a report saying the run never finished ([a crashed xdist worker or a session error](lanes.md#a-junit-that-says-the-run-did-not-finish)). Under `--reuse-artifacts` both of those are one warning instead, and the lane records no test counts: there the operator is reading a report off disk, which can be the junit of a run whose coverage was salvaged by hand. |
| `timeout_seconds` | int >= 0 | no | `0` | crapkit kills the command past this. The kill takes the whole process tree, not just the shell, and crapkit waits for it, so no orphan suite keeps running after the lane fails. `0` means no crapkit-owned timeout. |
| `no_progress_seconds` | int >= 0 | no | `0` | crapkit kills the command when its log has not grown for this many seconds. `timeout_seconds` has to be longer than your slowest honest run, so it cannot cut a suite that hangs early without cutting the slow ones too; this one measures output instead. Set it above the longest quiet stretch the runner has, since a silent build step before the tests looks the same as a hang. `0` means no progress watch. See [lanes.md](lanes.md#a-suite-that-stops-making-progress). |
| `retries` | int >= 0 | no | `0` | Reruns after a timeout or a missing artifact. Each attempt appends to the lane log under an `--- attempt N ---` header, and a failure message hoists its cause out of the last attempt alone, so the attempts before it are readable only in the log the message names. |
| `retest_command` | string | no | `""` | Rerun template for newly failed tests, before exit 8 is decided. See [lanes.md](lanes.md#flake-retest). |

---

## `[exclude]`

| Key | Type | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| `globs` | array of string | `[]` | Paths matching any glob leave the corpus. Each glob matches the **whole** repo-relative path, case-insensitively, and a leading `**/` matches zero or more directories, so one glob covers the repo root and every nested copy. |
| `max_file_bytes` | int >= 0 | absent (no limit) | Files larger than this leave the corpus entirely, minified blobs included. `doctor` reports each one as a `note`, never a FAIL, and the count surfaces as `skipped_max_bytes` in `inventory --json` and `coverage --json`. |

Test directories are excluded **unconditionally**, before `globs` is consulted: any path
component matching `test`, `tests` or `__tests__`, case-insensitively. You do not need a
glob for them, and you cannot glob your way back in.

Dot-directories go the same way, and for the same reason: any path with a component that
opens on a dot leaves the corpus before `globs` is read, `.github/workflows/gen.py` and
`.cursor/skills/skill.py` alike. `init` refuses to build a scope out of one, so a file in
there had nothing that could own it and came back from `doctor` as a tracked file matching
a scope language with no scope path. A dot *file* is not a dot directory and stays in.

A leading `**/` matches zero or more directories, so `**/dist/**` matches a repo-root
`dist/bundle.js` and `web/dist/bundle.js` alike, and never `src/distro/x.py`. Write each
pattern once; a root form such as `dist/**` is still read the way fnmatch reads it (the
root only), so a hand-written one keeps matching what it matched.

`crapkit init` writes this default set, one glob per line:

```toml
[exclude]
# A leading **/ matches zero or more directories, so each glob below reaches the
# repo root and every nested copy. Test directories leave the corpus on their own.
globs = [
  "**/node_modules/**",
  "**/dist/**",
  "**/build/**",
  "**/vendor/**",
  "**/generated/**",
  "**/__generated__/**",
  "**/*.generated.*",
  "**/*.test.*",
  "**/*.spec.*",
  "**/test_*.py",
  "**/*_test.py",
  "**/conftest.py",
  "**/*_test.go",
  "**/*.config.ts",
  "**/*.config.js",
  "**/*.config.mts",
]
```

The three `generated` entries keep generated clients and schemas out of the queue: a
generated tree scores like anyone else's debt, and on one monorepo a generated client at
CRAP 90 was the first `next-item`. The three `*.config.*` entries keep runner config files
(`vitest.config.ts` and friends) out of the unclaimed-file doctor check. `hook-precommit`
and `claude-hook` apply the same globs the scored corpus does, so a file the list excludes
is gated by neither.

**If your committed config carries only the nested form, its next scan moves files.**
Before 0.5.0 `**/dist/**` left a repo-root `dist/` in the corpus; it now excludes it, and
the same goes for a root `conftest.py` under `**/conftest.py` or a root `*.test.*` file
under `**/*.test.*`. Ratchet marks on a function that leaves the corpus are held, not
dropped. Run `crapkit doctor` after upgrading and read the per-scope file counts.

```
$ crapkit doctor
note app/core.py (181 bytes) skipped: over max_file_bytes
```

---

## Tuning the parallelism knobs

`doctor --tune` reads this machine's cpu count and whatever lane durations are already
recorded in `.crapkit/artifacts.json`, and prints paste-ready lines. It writes nothing and
runs nothing:

```
$ crapkit doctor --tune
# doctor --tune: suggestions for 24 cpu(s); nothing was written
[crapkit]
max_parallel_lanes = 1
analysis_workers = 23
mutation_workers = 6
# lane cost: 1.2s serial -> ~1.2s across 1 lane slot(s)
```

The cost line needs at least one recorded lane duration. With none it says so and the
suggestion comes from the cpu count alone. The suggestion never proposes more lane slots
than there are lanes.
