# Upgrading Crapkit

Upgrade the CLI with the installer that owns it, then refresh the measurements in
each repository. Saved runs describe the rules and source they measured; an upgrade
does not turn those runs into measurements of the new reader.

| Installation | Upgrade command |
|---|---|
| pip in the active environment | `python -m pip install --upgrade crapkit` |
| pip with the Python coverage extra | `python -m pip install --upgrade "crapkit[py]"` |
| uv tool | `uv tool upgrade crapkit` |

Check `crapkit --version` in the environment your shell, hook and MCP client use.
For a source checkout, follow [Development](../README.md#development). Stop a live
MCP server before upgrading on Windows; see [launcher locks](#windows-launcher-locks).

## Measure before changing marks

The 0.7.1 resource and cleanup fixes keep analysis version 10 and the 0.7.0
function identities. No ratchet migration or manual cache deletion is needed.
The package upgrade rebuilds the versioned analysis cache automatically.
Review the new [resource defaults](resources.md), especially bounded lane logs
and retention of default development test evidence. Restart each client's MCP
session after upgrading so its running server uses the new cleanup behavior.

Keep a copy of the committed ratchet and its diff before an upgrade. In each repo:

```sh
crapkit doctor
crapkit coverage --export .crapkit/current-functions.tsv
```

Resolve doctor failures, then inspect the fresh run. `coverage` writes a measurement
without applying the ratchet. Compare the saved marks with that measurement before
running `ratchet seed`, and finish with `crapkit verify` after reviewing and committing
any mark changes.

| What changed | Required action |
|---|---|
| Analysis or lizard stamp | Follow the [metric stamp rules](ratchet.md#the-metric-stamp). Comparisons refuse incompatible stamps. |
| Function membership or same-line identity | Review the [saved-mark mapping](ratchet.md#reconcile-saved-marks) before changing keys or stamps. |
| Coverage or JUnit producer | Run a fresh lane and resolve [artifact admission errors](lanes.md#a-junit-that-says-the-run-did-not-finish). |
| Shared exports or portable baselines | Upgrade readers before writing [encoded records](portable-records.md) for them. |

The reader is now analysis version 10, compared with version 9 in 0.6.0. It separates
JavaScript and TypeScript expression callbacks that older readers missed. Current
rows also carry an `occurrence` for functions sharing a start line. These changes can
shift anonymous ordinals even when functions begin on different lines. Fresh
coverage cannot prove which old function owned a mark. A refusal asks for that
review; replacing a stamp alone does not complete it.

Unambiguous legacy keys remain readable. Ambiguous groups and anonymous JS/TS marks
without current reader proof require the procedure in
[same-line function identity](ratchet.md#same-line-function-identity). Existing claims
without that proof continue to hold their whole name group until released,
removed by an explicit `runs prune` under its age rule, or the whole group becomes
healthy. Ordinary queue reads do not expire claims.

## Saved state and command behavior

Keep `.crapkit/crap.sqlite`: it holds run history, test baselines and override audits.
Commands manage disposable analysis and history caches themselves. Use
`crapkit runs list` to inspect the trusted baseline; a failed verify still prevents
a newer coverage run from silently becoming the baseline.

Automatic reuse now requires the same clean HEAD and unchanged configuration,
environment and artifact bytes. An older stamp without that proof reruns its lane.
Ignored inputs, installed dependencies and external services remain outside this
proof. See [artifact reuse](lanes.md#reusing-artifacts) before choosing an explicit
saved-artifact read.

Every mutation worker uses a detached worktree, including a single worker.
The normal pool is retained; concurrent callers use temporary worktrees that
cleanup removes. Budget disk space for the pool and use
`crapkit mutate --drop-pool` to reclaim it.
[Mutation worktrees](configuration.md#mutation-worktrees) owns the input, link,
concurrency and cleanup rules. [Command cleanup](lanes.md#the-kill-takes-the-whole-process-tree)
describes Windows Jobs and POSIX process groups. These are process-lifetime controls,
not a sandbox for configured test commands.

Git filenames retain their literal identity through scoring and output. Coverage
paths still have to name the measured tree. Use the documented
[CLI path rules](configuration.md#file-paths-and-root-discovery) and
[portable record reader](portable-records.md) when automating around exports.
JSON stays at `schema: 1`; consumers must accept added fields.

## Plugin and MCP clients

After upgrading the intended CLI, refresh Claude Code's marketplace before updating
its user-scope plugin:

```sh
claude plugin marketplace update crapkit
claude plugin update crapkit@crapkit --scope user
crapkit doctor --plugin-root
```

Restart existing Claude Code sessions to apply the plugin update. The doctor check
compares the installed plugin with the `crapkit` launcher on PATH. It does not reload
an existing session. A failed, malformed or undecodable launcher probe is a failure,
not a version match.

For an installed Codex plugin, refresh its marketplace and install the current copy:

```sh
codex plugin marketplace upgrade crapkit
codex plugin add crapkit@crapkit
codex plugin list --marketplace crapkit --json
crapkit doctor --plugin-root PATH
```

Use the installed Codex plugin directory for `PATH`, not the marketplace's source
checkout. In the default cache this is
`~/.codex/plugins/cache/crapkit/crapkit/VERSION`, using the installed version from
the listing. With no explicit path, doctor checks Claude Code's cache instead.
Use the three skills and MCP server in Codex. The advisory hook instructions in
the README configure Claude Code's PostToolUse event. Start a new Codex task to
load updated plugin skills and tools.

Start fresh MCP sessions after upgrading so their server uses the installed code. Other
MCP clients use the [stdio setup](agent-json.md#mcp-server); skill copies and custom
hook entries need their own update. Run packet commands as supplied, in the
environment that owns the intended CLI, to retain literal arguments and exit codes.

## Windows launcher locks

A running `crapkit.exe mcp` can hold the console launcher open. An upgrade then
fails with Windows error 32 even if some package files were already updated.

1. Stop the Crapkit MCP server or the agent session that owns it.
2. Rerun the same upgrade command and require a successful installer result.
3. Check `crapkit --version`, restart the client, and check plugin compatibility.

Use the installer to repair the launcher instead of copying executables between
environments. The CLI version alone does not prove an interrupted install finished.

## Release evidence

The [implementation report](architecture/2026-09-07-implementation/REPORT.md)
records complete Windows source and Linux installed-wheel verification, independent
reviews and repeatable performance probes. Its benchmark tables distinguish
synthetic duplication input, fixture setup and a fixed unit subset from complete
suite runs. They do not claim a whole-suite speedup. Hosted CI dispatch and macOS
runtime execution were outside that local verification.
