# The ratchet

The ratchet is a committed TSV of per-function high-water CRAP marks. It answers one
question: *has this function got worse than the day we agreed to live with it?*

**A mark only ever falls.** An improvement lowers it or drops it. A regression never raises
it; it fails the build instead. New debt enters only through `ratchet seed` or an audited
override, both of which are visible in a diff.

The pre-commit gate treats a mark as an exemption; `crapkit verify` fails a mark
that rises. See [the commit-gate rule](#the-commit-gate-skips-marked-functions).
When upgrading, review [function identity](#same-line-function-identity) before
reseeding marks recorded by an older reader.

Default file: `crapkit-ratchet.tsv` at the repo root, settable with `[crapkit] ratchet_file`.
Commit it.

## What a mark is

```
# crapkit-analysis=10 lizard=1.24.0
# crapkit-keys=1
path	long_name	crap
calc/grade.py	classify( score , attempts , late , bonus )	66.0714
calc/report.py	render( rows , wide , totals , header )	56.0000
```

Comments carrying the metric and key-format stamps, a header, then one row per mark:
path, key name, CRAP to four decimals. Rows are sorted by that pair, so the file is
diffable and merge conflicts are local.

Rows containing delimiters use the shared [portable record encoding](portable-records.md).
Ordinary three-column rows retain their bytes.

Identity is `(path, key name)`, never the line number. Spans drift on every edit; names
survive.

---

## Twins: one name, several functions

A file can give one name to more than one function. Python does it whenever a module holds
several dataclasses with a `__post_init__`, because a method's long name carries no class.
C does it whenever a platform shim forks on `#ifdef`, because both arms are textually
present. Neither is exotic; one repo reported three collisions.

**Each twin gets its own key.** The first keeps the bare name; the second is `name#2`, the
third `name#3`, counted in file order:

```
calc/iso_cost.py	__post_init__( self )	66.0714
calc/iso_cost.py	__post_init__( self )#2	30.0000
```

The ordinal, not the start line, because a line is invalidated by any edit above it and
would re-key marks nothing touched. Delete one twin and the rest renumber, which is honest:
they really are different functions now, and `prune` drops the key that no longer names one.

Before the ordinal, all of a file's twins shared `(path, long_name)`. One owned the key
and the rest were neither marked nor gated. For groups whose membership is unchanged,
twin #1 keeps the bare name and existing marks keep their meaning. Same-line callbacks
and callbacks recovered by a newer reader need the
[identity checks below](#same-line-function-identity) before their ordinals can be reused.

`analyze` prints one line per file naming the colliding names, so a `#2` in a marks diff
has an explanation:

```
crapkit: calc/iso_cost.py defines __post_init__( self ) more than once; each one takes its own ratchet key — the first as written, later ones suffixed #2, #3 in file order
```

To address one twin by hand, `brief` and `explain` take the same suffix:
`crapkit brief calc/iso_cost.py "__post_init__#2"`. A bare name still resolves, to the
worst twin: the one the queue ranks. `brief`, `explain` and the MCP tool
`get_function_history` all pick it, so the history and the mark each reports belong to
that twin, wherever it sits in the file.

---

## The commit gate skips marked functions

New in 0.4.0, and it decides which commits get refused. Read it before you seed a repo.

`hook-precommit` judges staged blobs. A blob carries no coverage, so a staged violation has
a ccn and no CRAP, and there is nothing to compare a mark against. The hook asks the one
question it can answer: does a `(path, key name)` mark exist? If it does, that function is
not gated, whatever the edit did to it. One stderr line reports the count, never a list:

```
crapkit gate: 1 staged function(s) carry a ratchet mark and were not gated — `crapkit verify` fails a mark that rises
```

The three gates read the file differently:

| Gate | What it holds | What a mark does there |
|---|---|---|
| `hook-precommit` | a staged blob: ccn, no coverage | skips the function on the mark's **existence** |
| `rescore --gate` | a scored row: ccn and CRAP | skips the function **at or under** the recorded value |
| `verify` | a full run | skips a touched function **at or under** the mark, as `rescore --gate` does; above the mark it is **exit 6** when the diff touched the function and **exit 7** when it did not |

The ratchet check in `verify` is unchanged: it still compares the numbers, and it is still
where a real regression is caught. Its gate reads a mark the way `rescore --gate` does
(#29): an edit inside a marked function that leaves it at or under its mark is the debt
the repo signed for, not a new violation; push it past the mark and both checks fire.

Both halves, on a repo whose `classify` carries the mark 51.5698. A comment added inside
it moves nothing, so step 3 and step 5 both pass:

```
$ crapkit rescore calc/grade.py --gate
rescore vs run 2 @ 4a06338604a (coverage STALE, complexity fresh)
   ccn   cov     crap  remedy      function
    13   39%     51.6  decompose   calc/grade.py:1  classify( score , attempts , late , bonus )
     5   62%      6.3  add-tests   calc/grade.py:25  summarize( rows , wide , totals , header )
EXIT=0

$ crapkit verify
verify OK @ 4a06338604a vs baseline 4a06338604a (1 changed files)
EXIT=0
```

Two more branches in the same function push it past 51.5698, and both refuse:

```
$ crapkit rescore calc/grade.py --gate
crapkit gate: 1 rescored function(s) over their scope ceiling:
  GATE  crap     83.0  ccn  17 cov 39%  calc/grade.py:1  classify( score , attempts , late , bonus )  -> decompose
EXIT=6

$ crapkit verify
verify FAILED @ 4a06338604a vs baseline 4a06338604a (1 changed files)
  GATE  crap     76.6  ccn  17 cov 41%  calc/grade.py:1  classify( score , attempts , late , bonus )  -> decompose  [dirty]
  RATCHET  calc/grade.py  classify( score , attempts , late , bonus ): 51.5698 -> 76.6293  [dirty]
  findings: 0 committed / 2 dirty (uncommitted edits and untracked files)
EXIT=6
```

Both findings are on one function and the verdict is **6**, because 6 beats 7. Exit 7 is
what is left for a function the diff never touched, which is the case further down under
[How `verify` uses the ratchet](#how-verify-uses-the-ratchet).

The looseness is deliberate. Before it, a comment added inside a marked function refused the
commit. On a repo carrying 40,303 marks that meant a seeded tree could not be touched, while
`rescore --gate` on the same tree passed. The advisory hook `crapkit claude-hook` exempts on
existence too, so a session of green advisories no longer ends at a red commit.

---

## Seeding

Seeding is how a legacy repo gets a ratchet. It records today's over-target functions as
accepted debt, so from then on the gate judges your edit instead of the repo's history.

```
$ crapkit coverage
run 1 @ 549e0ccdcdf: 3 functions scored: 2 measured / 1 untested, 2 over ceiling 6, CRAP load 124.07, grade F
-> next: crapkit worklist

$ crapkit ratchet seed
crapkit-ratchet.tsv: added 2, tightened 0 - 2 mark(s) vs run 1 (549e0ccdcdf)
```

`seed` marks every function over its scope ceiling from the latest full run, at its current
score. It is idempotent, and it can only lower: rerunning after an improvement reports
`tightened`, never `added`.

**Seed once, early.** Skipping it means a legacy repo's existing debt carries no marks, so
the ratchet check has nothing to compare and coverage rot on untouched code goes unnoticed.
`verify` still gates the diff, but the standing debt is unprotected. Since 0.5.1 every
verify counts that gap: `warning: N function(s) over the ceiling carry no ratchet mark, so
a rise on them (coverage loss included) passes unseen; record them with `crapkit ratchet
seed`` on stderr, and `unmarked_over_target` in `--json`. It fires no exit code and is
silent at zero, which is the state of a repo with no debt and of one seeded in full: a
header-only marks file is not a mistake, it says nothing is over the ceiling.

`ratchet seed` needs a **trusted** run in the store:

```
$ crapkit ratchet seed            # no store at all
crapkit: no snapshot in /repo — run `crapkit coverage` first
EXIT=1

$ crapkit ratchet seed            # inventory ran, but no lanes ever did
crapkit: no trusted full run to work from — run `crapkit coverage` first (failed verifies and hook runs never serve as baselines)
EXIT=1
```

### Seed and prune pick the run verify picks

Since 0.4.5 both actions run `verify`'s own baseline rule, not a weaker one that agrees with
it most of the time. Two clauses, in order.

**Trusted** means what it means for `verify`: a `coverage` run, or a `verify` run whose
verdict passed. A failed verify can carry the scores of a red tree, and a `partial` run
measured a fraction of the suite, so seeding from either would sign debt at values `verify`
refuses as a comparison point.

**A trusted run a failed verify stands in front of is refused too.** That failure recorded
findings against a tree; signing marks off anything newer moves the comparison point past
them, and no verify looks at them again. Only a passing verify clears it.

That second clause is the one that changed. A `coverage` run taken after a failed verify is
trusted, and seed used to take it. Here run 1 is a `coverage`, run 2 a verify that failed,
run 3 the fresh `coverage` somebody ran to move on. Both actions walk back to run 1:

```
$ crapkit ratchet seed
crapkit-ratchet.tsv: added 0, tightened 0 - 2 mark(s) vs run 1 (964eaf2ad80), skipped failed verify run 2

$ crapkit ratchet prune
crapkit-ratchet.tsv: pruned 0, followed 0 rename(s) - 2 mark(s) vs run 1 (964eaf2ad80), skipped failed verify run 2
```

The clause names the failed verifies only, so the ordinary line is unchanged when nothing was
skipped. `crapkit verify` on that store lands on run 1 too, and says so on stderr:

```
$ crapkit verify
warning: run 3 is not the baseline: verify run 2 FAILED with 1 finding(s) and no passing verify has cleared it since — measuring against run 1 @ 964eaf2ad80 instead, so those findings stay visible. Fix them, or pass `--baseline 3` to accept the newer run deliberately.
verify OK @ 964eaf2ad80 vs baseline 964eaf2ad80 (0 changed files)
```

Three commands, one run ([the trusted baseline](../README.md#the-trusted-baseline)).

When the failure stands in front of every trusted run there is, both refuse rather than
signing anything:

```
$ crapkit ratchet seed
crapkit: no run to work from: verify run 1 FAILED with 1 finding(s), nothing older is left to work from, and a fresh `crapkit coverage` would only be refused the same way — fix the findings and let a verify pass
EXIT=1
```

The line says why a fresh `coverage` is not the escape: the new run would be refused by the
same rule. Fix the findings, or accept a newer run by name with `crapkit verify --baseline
ID` and let that verify pass.

---

## The metric stamp

Scores measured under different rules are not comparable. The file's first line records the
analysis version and the lizard behind the numbers, so crapkit can refuse instead of
comparing them silently.

Three cases:

| Recorded stamp | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Matches the running metric | Compare normally. |
| Differs | **Refused**, exit 3. |
| Absent (a file written before stamping) | Warn, then apply the function-identity checks below. Anonymous JavaScript/TypeScript marks need reader proof. |

```
$ crapkit verify
crapkit: ratchet marks were recorded under [crapkit-analysis=7 lizard=1.24.0] but this run measures [crapkit-analysis=8 lizard=1.24.0] — CRAP scores are not comparable across metric versions; run `crapkit coverage`, then re-baseline with `crapkit ratchet seed`
EXIT=3
```

```
$ crapkit verify
warning: crapkit-ratchet.tsv carries no metric stamp (written before stamping) — run `crapkit coverage`, then re-baseline with `crapkit ratchet seed` to stamp it
verify OK @ 525a3276065 vs baseline 525a3276065 (1 changed files)
EXIT=0
```

Every write to the marks file sets the stamp by where its numbers came from:

| Write | Metric stamp it leaves |
|---|---|
| `ratchet seed` | The metric the run it read was measured under. The only write that replaces a recorded metric stamp. |
| `ratchet prune`, `ratchet move`, the merge driver | The recorded stamp. None of them adds a number. A marks file prune creates holds no mark and takes the running metric. |
| `verify`'s tighten, `verify --override` | The running metric. Marks another metric recorded are refused before the lanes run; a file written before stamping gains its stamp. |
| The pre-commit hook's override | The recorded stamp. A marks file it creates takes the running metric. |

Seed and prune run their identity checks first. An upgrade that changes which functions a
reader finds needs a reviewed mapping first; fresh coverage alone cannot supply it. See
[same-line function identity](#same-line-function-identity). The merge driver writes the
stamps both sides already shared, so two legacy sides stay legacy.

Upgrading lizard or the analysis version changes the running metric, so the next comparison
refuses existing marks. Run `crapkit coverage` first, then `ratchet seed`: a seed from a run
the older version measured signs the older metric, and verify keeps refusing. The seed line
says so, and prune's line names the run's metric the same way:

```
$ crapkit ratchet seed
crapkit-ratchet.tsv: added 0, tightened 0 - 2 mark(s) vs run 9 (4a06338604a); run 9 was measured under [crapkit-analysis=9 lizard=1.24.0], not this crapkit's [crapkit-analysis=10 lizard=1.24.0], so verify refuses these marks until a fresh `crapkit coverage` and another seed
```

A run stored before crapkit recorded its metric vouches for none, and seed refuses it:

```
$ crapkit ratchet seed
crapkit: ratchet seed: run 3 recorded no metric (analysis version and lizard), so the marks it measured cannot be stamped; run `crapkit coverage` and seed again
EXIT=3
```

Reseeding from a fresh run can update compatible marks; changed function membership needs
the identity review below first.

### Upgrading to 0.4.5: analysis version 8

This historical transition changed analysis version 7 to 8. The verify refusal quoted
above belongs to that upgrade; the current reader uses version 10. Follow
[Upgrading](upgrading.md) for current saved-state checks. In the older transition,
reseeding from a fresh coverage run updated the stamp as follows:

```
$ crapkit ratchet seed
crapkit-ratchet.tsv: added 0, tightened 0 - 2 mark(s) vs run 9 (4a06338604a)

$ head -1 crapkit-ratchet.tsv
# crapkit-analysis=8 lizard=1.24.0
```

What version 8 changed is one rule: shell cognitive complexity now nests, because `fi`,
`done` and `esac` close a level. A 4-deep `if` in a `.sh` file reads 10, the way it does in
every other language crapkit scans, instead of 4. So **cognitive numbers move in shell
files and nowhere else, and ccn does not move at all.** CRAP is built from ccn and coverage,
so the marks themselves land where they landed before; the re-seed from a run measured under
version 8 is the stamp catching up, not a repricing of the debt.

A repo with no shell in it still has to re-seed. The stamp records the rules the numbers
were measured under, not which of them a given file exercised.

---

## Pruning, and renames

`prune` drops marks whose function is absent from the latest run, and nothing else drops
them. Absence alone is not proof the code left: an exclude glob or a lane outage removes rows
too, and the per-verify update keeps stale entries rather than erasing an audited override's
only diff-visible record. Running `prune` is you confirming.

```
$ crapkit ratchet prune
crapkit-ratchet.tsv: pruned 0, followed 2 rename(s) - 2 mark(s) vs run 11 (7d09097ea8a)
```

**A rename follows instead of dropping.** Before pruning, crapkit asks git for renames since
the store's first run and re-paths any mark that meets all three conditions:

1. The function is gone from its recorded path.
2. git calls that path renamed.
3. The same key name exists at the destination.

A *copy* fails condition 1 (the source survives), so a copy never moves a mark. Before and
after `git mv calc/grade.py calc/grading.py`:

```
calc/grade.py	audit( rows , strict , cap , floor , verbose )	132.0000
calc/grading.py	audit( rows , strict , cap , floor , verbose )	132.0000
```

### A crapkit root below the git top

Marks are keyed on paths relative to the crapkit root, and since 0.4.5 every git spawn asks
git for that same spelling (`diff.relative=true`). A root below the repository top follows
renames like any other. Here the top holds `pkg/`, crapkit runs in `pkg`, and the rename is
`git mv pkg/calc/grade.py pkg/calc/grading.py`:

```
$ crapkit ratchet prune
crapkit-ratchet.tsv: pruned 0, followed 1 rename(s) - 2 mark(s) vs run 2 (db28702d61c)
```

The marks file says `calc/grade.py` before and `calc/grading.py` after, and carries the
`pkg/` prefix at neither end. Before 0.4.5 git answered these diffs top-relative, so the
rename `pkg/calc/grade.py` matched no mark and the mark dropped instead of moving. The rest
of that story is in
[AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md#when-crapkits-root-sits-below-the-git-top).

### Moving marks by hand

When git cannot see the rename (a vendored tree, a rewritten history), state it:

```
$ crapkit ratchet move calc/grade.py calc/grading.py
crapkit-ratchet.tsv: moved 2 mark(s) from calc/grade.py to calc/grading.py
```

A trailing `/` on the old path moves a whole directory:

```
$ crapkit ratchet move calc/ scoring/
crapkit-ratchet.tsv: moved 2 mark(s) from calc/ to scoring/
```

Values never change. A move that matches nothing is a config error rather than a silent
no-op:

```
$ crapkit ratchet move nope/x.py y.py
crapkit: ratchet move: no mark under nope/x.py in crapkit-ratchet.tsv (a directory must end in '/')
EXIT=3
```

`move` needs no run and no store; it reads the file and rewrites it.

Both paths are read like every other path argument, so the marks land under the key a
scored row carries. `./calc/grading.py` and, on Windows, `calc\grading.py` name
`calc/grading.py`. Typed from a directory below the root, a path is read from there: in
`calc/`, `crapkit ratchet move grade.py grading.py` is the first example above. Under
`--repo` the paths stay root-relative. The line names the paths as the marks file spells them.

---

## The git merge driver

Two branches that both burn down debt produce two different ratchet files, and git's default
text merge will conflict on adjacent lines. Hand-resolving a conflict is exactly where
somebody accidentally raises a mark, which the whole design forbids.

Install the driver. Two steps, both required.

**1. `.gitattributes`, committed:**

```
crapkit-ratchet.tsv merge=crapkit-ratchet
```

**2. `git config`, run once per clone** (git will not take a driver command from a committed
file, by design, so this cannot be automated away):

```
git config merge.crapkit-ratchet.driver "crapkit ratchet merge %O %A %B"
git config merge.crapkit-ratchet.name "crapkit ratchet 3-way merge"
```

The `.driver` line is the one that matters; `.name` is only a description git shows. Put
both in your CONTRIBUTING setup steps.

`%O %A %B` are base, ours, theirs. The driver writes the merged result **in place over
`%A`** and exits 0, which is what git requires of a merge driver.

Live, merging a branch that added a mark into a branch that tightened another:

```
$ git merge feature -m "merge feature"
ratchet merge: 2 mark(s)
Auto-merging crapkit-ratchet.tsv
Merge made by the 'ort' strategy.
```

```
# crapkit-analysis=8 lizard=1.24.0
path	long_name	crap
app/a.py	foo( x )	31.5000
app/b.py	bar( y )	22.0000
```

`foo` kept main's tightened 31.5 and `bar` arrived from the feature branch. Per key, the
side that changed wins over the side that did not; when both changed the **lower** value
wins, because a mark can only fall and `prune` is re-runnable.

Per key means per twin. One branch tightening `__post_init__` and the other tightening
`__post_init__#2` in the same file is not a conflict, because those are two keys; the driver
needs no ordinal knowledge to get that right. The `#` sits in the name field, so a marks line
never opens with the `#` that introduces the metric stamp.

The driver refuses to merge across metric versions, and git falls back to a normal text
conflict for you to resolve after re-seeding one side:

```
$ git merge legacy
crapkit: ratchet merge refused: ours is [crapkit-analysis=8 lizard=1.24.0] and theirs is [unstamped] — marks from different metric versions cannot merge; run `crapkit coverage`, then re-baseline one side with `crapkit ratchet seed`
Auto-merging crapkit-ratchet.tsv
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in crapkit-ratchet.tsv
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

The historical example joins stamps from different reader versions. Bring both
branches through the [upgrade checks](upgrading.md#measure-before-changing-marks)
and review function identity before restamping. The merge driver also refuses
different key-format versions; matching metric stamps alone are not enough.

`ratchet merge` runs with no `crapkit.toml` in sight, because git invokes it from a temp
directory. It is the one ratchet subcommand that needs no config.

---

## Reporting the burn-down

`ratchet report` answers two questions: how much debt is still open, and how fast it is being
repaid.

```
$ crapkit ratchet report
ratchet burn-down: 2 open mark(s), 0 repaid (0 in the last 30d, 0 in 90d)
      0d  calc/grade.py  classify( score , attempts , late , bonus )
      0d  calc/report.py  render( rows , wide , totals , header )
```

Ages and repayment velocity come from the ratchet file's **own git history**, replayed patch
by patch. No timestamp lives in the TSV, so a fixed history reports the same numbers forever.
Everything anchors on the newest commit in that history, never the wall clock.

Which marks are *open* is a question about now, so that reads the working tree. A seed you
have not committed yet is still debt somebody owes, and the report says so:

```
$ crapkit ratchet seed
crapkit-ratchet.tsv: added 1, tightened 0 - 1 mark(s) vs run 2 (d9cdcfdcb1a)

$ crapkit ratchet report
ratchet burn-down: 1 open mark(s), 0 repaid (0 in the last 30d, 0 in 90d)
  1 uncommitted mark(s) in crapkit-ratchet.tsv: open reads the working tree, ages and repayment read committed history
      0d  calc/grade.py  classify( score , attempts , late , bonus )
```

A mark with no commit behind it reports `0d`. The burn-down clock starts when you commit the
file.

---

## The debt policy

Two optional `[crapkit]` keys turn the report into a gate:

| Key | Flags |
|---|---|
| `debt_max_age_months` | Open marks older than this, counted at 30 days per month. |
| `repayment_min_per_30d` | A burn-down that repaid fewer marks than this in the last 30 days, while debt is open. |

`--enforce` evaluates them and exits 1 on a violation:

```
$ crapkit ratchet report --enforce
ratchet burn-down: 2 open mark(s), 1 repaid (1 in the last 30d, 1 in 90d)
  POLICY repayment stalled: 1 mark(s) repaid in 30d (policy wants 5)
      0d  calc/grade.py  audit( rows , strict , cap , floor , verbose )
      0d  calc/grade.py  classify( score , attempts , late , bonus )
EXIT=1
```

With neither key set, `--enforce` can never fire. In `--json`, `policy_violations`
distinguishes the three states honestly:

| `policy_violations` | Means |
|---|---|
| `null` | No policy was evaluated: `--enforce` was absent, or no debt knobs are configured. |
| `[]` | The policy ran and found nothing. |
| `["..."]` | Violations, and the exit code is 1. |

Do not read `[]` off a call without `--enforce`. There is none to read.

---

## How `verify` uses the ratchet

A clean pass tightens it automatically. After a green `verify`:

- A marked function now at or under its ceiling loses its mark entirely.
- A marked function still over its ceiling keeps the **lower** of its mark and its fresh
  score.
- A marked function absent from the run keeps its mark untouched. Absence is not proof the
  code is gone; that is what `prune` is for.

The marks file is written only when its text would change, and never created to hold zero
marks: a clean checkout with no marks file stays clean, and a stamped file whose marks all
held stays byte-identical. When the run did rewrite it, the OK line says what moved and what
to do about it:

```
$ crapkit verify
verify OK @ 8c780bb18da vs baseline 8c780bb18da (3 changed files) ratchet: 6 dropped, 1 tightened -> git add crapkit-ratchet.tsv
```

`dropped` counts marks whose function is now at or under its ceiling; `tightened` counts
marks that fell. The JSON receipt carries the same two numbers as `ratchet_changes`, `null`
when the tighten wrote nothing ([agent-json.md](agent-json.md#verify)). One rewrite moves no
mark: a file written before stamping (the one `verify` warns about on stderr) is rewritten
once to gain its stamp line, and the OK line says `ratchet: restamped -> git add
crapkit-ratchet.tsv` instead of two zero counts.

A run that passed **because of an `--override`** does not tighten anything. The override
already wrote the debt it granted, and letting the same run also rewrite every other mark
would mix a granted exemption into a routine tightening.

A function scoring worse than its mark is a ratchet regression, whether or not the diff
touched it. That is the point: coverage rot regresses functions nobody edited.

```
$ crapkit verify
verify FAILED @ 8c780bb18da vs baseline 8c780bb18da (1 changed files)
  RATCHET  app/m.py  pick( a , b , c ): 10.75 -> 20.0
  findings: 1 committed / 0 dirty (uncommitted edits and untracked files)
EXIT=7
```

That run changed only a test file. The source function was untouched; deleting its coverage
was enough.

Comparison happens at the precision the mark is stored at (four decimals). `cov` is a
division, so long decimals are routine and an unrounded compare would wedge an unchanged
tree against its own mark.

The gates read the same file and ask it a looser question, `verify`'s own gate included
since #29. See [The commit gate skips marked functions](#the-commit-gate-skips-marked-functions).

### Damping a measurement that bounces

Tightening a mark claims the code improved, and one commit measured twice cannot have
improved. So `verify` compares each marked function against what the same commit's previous
**trusted** run measured, and refuses to tighten a mark whose CRAP moved by more than
`[crapkit] tighten_max_jump` (default `2.0`) between those two runs. The mark stays where it
is and one line goes to stderr:

```
  NO TIGHTEN  app/hook.py  _judge( raw ): measurement moved 20.0 -> 72.0 on the same commit; not tightening
```

Without this, a coverage input that measures the same bytes two ways makes the gate a coin
flip: the lucky run pulls the mark down to 20.0, the unlucky one fails it at exit 7, and the
marks file churns 20 -> 72 -> 20 in commits. Real work moves a score by less than a
measurement race does, so a stable improvement still tightens in full. A first run of a
commit has nothing to compare against and tightens as it always did. `verify --no-tighten`
is the blunt version: the verdict stands and the marks file is not rewritten at all.

**Trusted** is the same word `ratchet seed` uses, and the same test: a failed verify and a
`partial` run are invisible here too. Both carry numbers no other reader accepts — a failed
verify's can come off a red tree, and a `partial` run measured a fraction of the suite, so
its coverage is low and its CRAP is high to match. Damping against either would hold a mark
at a value nothing vouches for.

Seeding narrows it once more, and damping does not: `seed` and `prune` also refuse a trusted
run a failed verify stands in front of ([above](#seed-and-prune-pick-the-run-verify-picks)),
because they are choosing what to sign. Damping signs nothing. It asks whether one number
moved between two measurements of one commit, and the older measurement only has to be one
`verify` would have accepted.

The comparison is per ratchet key, so a file's second
`__post_init__` is compared against `__post_init__#2`'s earlier score and not against its
twin's ([Twins: one name, several functions](#twins-one-name-several-functions)).

## Overrides and the audit trail

An override is a human granting audited debt, not a bypass. **Three records or nothing**:

1. An alert line through `[crapkit] alert_command` on stdin. It fires first, because it is
   the step most likely to fail.
2. A row in the snapshot store's override log.
3. An entry in the committed ratchet, staged into the pending commit, so the debt is
   diff-visible.

A failure between step 2 and step 3 leaves an audit trail with no grant, never a grant with
no trail. Without `alert_command` the override is refused outright, before anything happens:

```
$ crapkit verify --override "shipping the hotfix, ticket 412"
crapkit: no alert_command configured — the override requires a visible alert line; set [crapkit] alert_command in crapkit.toml
EXIT=3
```

With it configured:

```
$ crapkit verify --override "shipping the hotfix, ticket 412"
verify OK @ 8c780bb18da vs baseline 8c780bb18da (2 changed files) ratchet: 1 mark granted -> git add crapkit-ratchet.tsv
  OVERRIDDEN  app/m.py:9  route( a , b , c , d )
EXIT=0
```

The grant is the override's own write to the marks file, so the OK line ends with the same
`git add` a tighten's does; `ratchet_changes` stays `null` in the JSON receipt, the grant
being listed under `overridden`.

```
$ crapkit overrides
run  10 @ 8c780bb18da 2026-08-23T01:36:42Z  crap 56.0  app/m.py  route( a , b , c , d )  (shipping the hotfix, ticket 412)
```

An override grants gate violations and nothing else. A ratchet regression or a new test
failure in the same run refuses it, and the refusal is one stderr line naming the cause and
the escape; the exit code stays the verdict's:

```
$ crapkit verify --override "hotfix INV-412 ships tonight; decompose next sprint"
verify FAILED @ 8c780bb18da vs baseline 8c780bb18da (1 changed files)
  GATE  crap    380.0  ccn  19 cov 0%  app/billing/invoice.py:88  check_band( r , t )  -> decompose
  RATCHET  app/billing/invoice.py  check_band( r , t ): 240.0 -> 380.0
  findings: 1 committed / 0 dirty (uncommitted edits and untracked files)
override refused: 1 ratchet regression (app/billing/invoice.py check_band( r , t ) 240.0 -> 380.0) never qualifies for an override; raise the mark by hand and commit it
EXIT=6
```

The rule, stated once: **a mark never rises through `verify`.** A marked function the edit
pushed past its mark carries a gate violation and a regression in one payload
([agent-json.md](agent-json.md#verify)), so the override path never reaches it, and the only
way to accept that debt is to raise the mark in `crapkit-ratchet.tsv` by hand and commit the
change where a reviewer sees it. A new test failure is refused from the other side: the
override records debt in the marks file, and a failing test is not debt a mark can carry;
fix the test first. A run holding both causes is refused once, both on the line. A refused
override writes no alert line, no store row and no mark. Under `--json` the line is on
stderr and stdout stays one object.

The pre-commit hook takes the same path through `CRAPKIT_OVERRIDE_REASON`:

```
$ CRAPKIT_OVERRIDE_REASON="hotfix 412, decompose in the follow-up" git commit -m "add route"
crapkit gate: 1 staged function(s) exceed the complexity ceiling of 6:
  ccn   7  app/m.py:9  route( a , b , c , d )
crapkit: override granted with full audit (hotfix 412, decompose in the follow-up).
crapkit: clear CRAPKIT_OVERRIDE_REASON now (`unset CRAPKIT_OVERRIDE_REASON`) — while set it grants again on every commit.
crapkit: a CI job or a launcher that exported it is not cleared by any command here — clear it where it was set.
```

That first line is spelled for the shell you are in: `unset` is a POSIX builtin, so on
Windows the receipt names `$env:CRAPKIT_OVERRIDE_REASON = $null` for PowerShell and
`set CRAPKIT_OVERRIDE_REASON=` for cmd.exe instead.

The hook path never raises an existing mark. It has no coverage data, so it synthesizes a
worst-case score, and letting that overwrite a real measurement would blind the ratchet to a
later coverage collapse. A prior tighter mark stays, and the next `verify` still demands
repayment.

The hook path leaves the metric stamp alone too. Its score comes from ccn alone and it compares
no mark, so a marks file stamped under an older metric keeps that stamp, and the next `verify`
still refuses it until a fresh `crapkit coverage` and `crapkit ratchet seed` re-baseline the
marks. A marks file the grant creates takes the stamp of the crapkit that ran it. A
`verify --override` grant is measured, so marks another metric recorded refuse it the way they
refuse `verify` itself.

The kept stamp also decides whether the hook can grant an anonymous JavaScript or TypeScript
callback. Under a stamp older than analysis version 10, the `(anonymous)` mark the grant adds
has no reader proof, and every later reader would refuse the file (see
[same-line function identity](#same-line-function-identity)). So the hook refuses that grant
and writes no alert line, no store row and no mark. The grant is refused until
`crapkit coverage` and `crapkit ratchet seed` restamp the file.

An empty reason is refused. Runs an override names are pinned in the store: `runs prune`
never deletes them.

## Adoption checklist

```
crapkit init                # scopes, a lane, .gitignore
crapkit doctor              # the config still describes the repo
crapkit coverage            # a scored run exists
crapkit ratchet seed        # existing debt gets marks
git add crapkit.toml crapkit-ratchet.tsv .gitignore
git commit -m "adopt crapkit"
crapkit verify              # should be green on the tree you just committed
```

Then install the gate ([README](../README.md#the-gate)) and the merge driver above.

## Same-line function identity

Several callbacks can start on one source line. New records include `occurrence`,
their creation order within that line. Canonical marks still use the raw name and
`#N` ordinal, now ordered by `(start, occurrence)`.

The two stamps answer different questions:

| Stamp | What it records |
| --- | --- |
| `# crapkit-analysis=10 lizard=1.24.0` | The reader and metric rules that produced the function set and scores. |
| `# crapkit-keys=1` | Ordinals ordered by `(start, occurrence)`. |

A missing key-version comment means the old start-only rule. For unchanged groups
whose reader identity is proved, seed, prune and a successful tightening can keep
the keys and values and add the new key marker. Marks for absent names retain the
old key format until their mapping can be checked. Named functions and functions
in other languages keep compatible reseed behavior when their groups have no
unresolved collision. An explicit move preserves both stamps; a merge refuses
different key versions without rewriting OURS.

### Same-line collisions and recovered callbacks

If a legacy marked name has two functions starting on the same line, its entire
name group needs review. A collision also shifts later ordinals: two callbacks on
line 1 can move the old second callback on line 10 from `#2` to `#3`. Available
historical runs participate in this check. Their commit IDs alone cannot prove
source identity because a run may have measured uncommitted code.

Analysis reader 10 also recovers JavaScript and TypeScript expression callbacks
that older readers missed, including siblings on different lines. For example,
old anonymous functions at lines 2 and 6 become functions at lines 2, 3 and 6.
The old `#2` belongs to line 6; the new `#2` belongs to line 3. Neither function
set has a same-start collision, so the key-format marker alone cannot prove the
mapping.

For anonymous groups in `.js`, `.cjs`, `.mjs`, `.ts`, `.tsx` and `.jsx` files,
missing, malformed or pre-10 reader proof refuses comparisons, seed, prune and
override, even when `# crapkit-keys=1` is already present. The refusal leaves marks
unchanged; an override emits no alert or audit record. An old stored run also
cannot supply anonymous marks that seed labels as reader 10. New runs record
their analysis version in `tool_versions.analysis_version`.

### Reconcile saved marks

Fresh coverage describes the current functions. It cannot establish which
original function owned an old mark. Reconcile the mapping before restamping:

1. Run `crapkit coverage --export .crapkit/current-functions.tsv` to inspect current
   rows, including `start` and `occurrence`, without applying the ratchet.
2. Compare each affected old key with the source that its mark measured. Review
   the group's whole ordinal sequence, including functions on later lines and
   siblings the old reader missed. Keep a copy of the original ratchet.
3. Edit only the affected keys in the ratchet. Carry each existing value to the
   function it belongs to and retain unrelated marks. Review any mark whose
   original function cannot be established before assigning or removing it.
4. After every affected group has a reviewed mapping, record the current run's
   analysis/lizard stamp and add `# crapkit-keys=1`. If only the key format changed
   and the metric stamp already matches, retain that metric stamp. Changing either
   comment without proving the mapping does not reconcile the marks.
5. Run `crapkit ratchet seed` against the fresh run to record remaining measured
   debt, review the diff, commit the focused change, then run `crapkit verify`.

If an original function cannot be established, leave its mark and stamps intact
until that mapping is resolved. A blanket seed cannot perform this review.

### Claims and coverage

Old claims without position proof, and anonymous claims taken from runs without
current reader proof, hold the whole raw-name group. They remain held until
released, expired by an explicit `runs prune` under its existing age rule, or all
functions in the group become healthy. The existing commit-history release rule
also applies. See the [claim lifecycle](agent-json.md#claims). Release uses the
saved handle and leaves unrelated claims intact. Claims from current runs can
still reserve individual callbacks.

`occurrence` distinguishes parsed functions. Line-only coverage artifacts still
cannot distinguish callbacks whose source spans are identical; it does not add
coverage columns that the artifact did not provide.
