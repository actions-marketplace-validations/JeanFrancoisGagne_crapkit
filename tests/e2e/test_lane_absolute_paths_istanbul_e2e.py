"""End-to-end: the istanbul half of the absolute-path refusal.

`tests/e2e/test_lane_absolute_paths_e2e.py` proves the coveragepy half three
ways and never builds an istanbul lane, so the advice a JS consumer meets
(`coverage_istanbul.ABSOLUTE_FIX`) had nothing behind it. The two messages name different knobs,
and the istanbul one is the harder to write: the reader strips this checkout's
root off every measured path literally, so a path that stayed absolute means the
reporter spelled that root some other way, and no key on the lane can rebase it.

Staging it needs a root spelled two ways, because a reporter that spells the
root exactly as crapkit does is rebased and joins fine. The lane's script
reaches the checkout through its parent (`<parent>/mini-build/../mini/src`),
which is what a reporter given an unnormalized `root` or `cwd` writes into every
key. crapkit's own root is the normalized spelling, the literal strip misses,
and the key stays absolute while still resolving under the checkout. Case and
symlinks stage the same thing on one platform each; this spelling stages it on
both.

The artifact cannot be committed: its keys carry the tmp directory the fixture
is copied into. The lane writes it, the way the coveragepy test's lane does.
