"""An in-process CLI call past its bound fails its own test, and the session goes on.

The call runs in the worker's thread, so no child can be killed when it hangs.
Ending the worker instead lost the report: pytest's capture owned descriptor 2,
the stack dump went into the capture file and died with the worker, and xdist
said only that the worker crashed. Serial, the whole session ended with no
failure report and no summary. These tests run a real pytest session in a
child, serial and under one xdist worker, because only a session shows whether
the next test still runs.
