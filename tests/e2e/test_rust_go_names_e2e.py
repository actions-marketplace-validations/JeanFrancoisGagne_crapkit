"""Naming a Rust or Go function on the command line, through the real CLI.

Three defects meet here, all of them found by a fresh session on a Rust repo:

  * `brief src/lib.rs route` was rejected. lizard prints a Rust signature as
    `route cmd : & Cmd` and a Go one as `Classify n int`, with no parenthesis to
    cut at, so the packet's `handle` was the whole signature and the bare name
    it advertised was a string nothing accepted back.
  * `explain src/lib.rs route` answered with `route`, `route_chain` and
    `route_num`, because it ran a SQL LIKE where `brief` matched exactly.
  * the Rust `match` those functions dispatch on scored 0 cognitive.

Everything asserts through a subprocess CLI on a tmp_path repo, because the
defect a session hit was in what the command accepted, not in what a helper
returned. The scores are hand-counted beside the sources.
