"""One CLI call run inside the pytest worker, reported as a child would report it.

A spawned `python -m crapkit` pays for an interpreter start, crapkit's imports
and coverage's startup hook before the command runs: measured at 54 ms for
`--version` on a quiet machine, 148 ms under the py lane's coverage patch, and
the suite makes about 1,750 such calls. `crapkit.cli.main(argv)` is the entry
point `python -m crapkit` reaches, so the worker can call it directly, provided
it rebuilds what the child had and puts the worker back afterwards:

- cwd and os.environ are the child's for the call, and the worker's after it.
  tempfile forgets the directory it cached for the worker, so the call's
  TMPDIR, TEMP and TMP choose its temp dir as they would a child's.
- File descriptors 1 and 2 point at a temp file each for the call, so output
  from crapkit and from any command it starts with inherited stdio (a
  test-scoped runner, a lane) lands where the child's pipes would have caught
  it. sys.stdout and sys.stderr are new text streams on those descriptors,
  opened the way Python opens a child's.
- sys.stdin holds the bytes the child would have read, sys.argv what
  `python -m crapkit` sets (crapkit spells itself in messages from argv[0]),
  and warnings print to stderr under a new interpreter's filters.
- crapkit's functools caches are empty on entry and on exit: a probe cached for
  one PATH must not answer the next test, which may have another.
- The call's garbage is collected on the way out, which closes the store the
  way a process exit does.
- crapkit's analysis pool refuses with a RuntimeError. On Linux the pool forks
  the worker, and a repo past 32 cold files asks for it there; Windows asks
  only for a bigger repo, so the refusal holds on every OS.
- The status is main's return or SystemExit's code. An uncaught exception is
  exit 1 with its traceback on stderr, which is how the interpreter reports one.
- The bytes are decoded as subprocess.run decodes a child's: the caller's
  encoding or the locale's, the caller's errors or strict, universal newlines.

What it cannot rebuild is the process boundary itself: the console entry point,
the child's own stdio encoding, exit codes as the OS reports them, a killed
process, and environment the interpreter reads only as it starts (PYTHONPATH,
PYTHONIOENCODING, PYTHONUTF8, PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE, PYTHONSAFEPATH and the
other PYTHON* variables). A variable any other stdlib module caches on first
use is the worker's too, tempfile's aside. Files that need any of these, or a
repo big enough for the analysis pool, keep `spawn=True` (AGENTS.md says
which). The commands crapkit starts are real children and get the call's
whole environment.

Two calls cannot run at once, since each one owns the process for its
duration; a second call while one is running raises instead of corrupting both.

A call past its bound fails its own test, as the spawn path's kill-on-timeout
does. A watch thread raises _PastBound in the call's thread, which arrives at
its next Python instruction; a BaseException, so crapkit's `except Exception`
handlers let it through. Every context above puts the worker back on the way
out, and the test fails with an AssertionError naming argv, the bound and what
the call printed, chained to _PastBound's traceback, which shows where the call
was when it stopped. The session goes on. A thread stuck in C code never
reaches another Python instruction, so GRACE_SECONDS later faulthandler writes
every thread's stack to the file `log_hangs_to` named, and the worker exits.
The suite names a file under the worker's basetemp, because pytest's capture
owns descriptor 2 during a test and a dump sent there dies with the worker.
