"""Protocol 1: a recorded Claude Code hook payload on stdin, an exit code and a
line of stderr out.

Each golden under tests/goldens/claude_hook/ carries a payload shaped the way a
live PostToolUse event arrives, the fixture repo it was recorded against, and
the verdict it must draw. The test builds the repo, spawns the real subcommand,
and diffs. Nothing here reaches into the module: an adapter for another harness
maps its own payload onto the same JSON and these files still decide.

Two rules hold across every case, so they are asserted on every case:

- stdout is always empty. Protocol 1 reserves it for a future JSON channel, and
  Claude Code parses stdout JSON on exit 0.
- the process runs from a directory that is not the repo. The root comes from
  the edited file's own path, never from cwd and never from
  ${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}, which stays at the session root while an edit follows a
  worktree.
