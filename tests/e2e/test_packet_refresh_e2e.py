"""`commands.refresh` has to clear what `stale` complains about.

The packet used to answer its own staleness warning with another `brief`, which
re-reads the very snapshot that is stale: a session that followed the field got
the same `stale: true` back and no way forward. This runs the string the packet
prints, verbatim, against a repo whose HEAD has moved past its run, and checks
the flag actually goes down.

The budget pin lives here too, because it is a claim about two commands rather
than about one function: `brief` and `next-item` have to publish the same
estimates for the same row.
