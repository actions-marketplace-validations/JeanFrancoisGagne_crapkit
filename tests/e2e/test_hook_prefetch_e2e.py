"""The hook's two git reads start before the analysis stack is imported.

Neither answer is needed until both have been paid for: on Windows each git
spawn costs ~18ms of process creation and importing lizard costs ~31ms, and the
staged diff and `cat-file --batch` do not depend on the import at all. Starting
them first runs the spawns underneath it.

The order is the whole change, so the order is what is asserted — and with it
the contract it could quietly break: an installation with no lizard still exits
5 with the same sentence, rather than reporting a gate verdict it cannot have.
