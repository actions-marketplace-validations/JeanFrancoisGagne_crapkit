"""A globally registered MCP server starts wherever the client opened, and that
is usually not a crapkit repo.

`crapkit mcp` used to load the config before serving, so in a directory with no
crapkit.toml the process died on the first line of stdio: the client saw a
server that never answered `initialize`, with the reason on a stderr nobody
reads. The tools are read-only and every one of them names its own repo, so a
missing config is a per-call answer, not a dead server.

Real subprocesses, newline-delimited JSON-RPC, exactly what a client sends.
