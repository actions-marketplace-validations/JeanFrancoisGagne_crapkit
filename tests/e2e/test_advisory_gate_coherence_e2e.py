"""The advisory and the commit gate, asked about the same tree, in one test.

They are two programs reading two things. `claude-hook` reads the working tree
and `git diff HEAD`; `hook-precommit` reads staged blobs. They were also built
apart, and they disagreed: the same comment inside a marked function drew a
green advisory mid-session and exit 6 at `git commit`, because one honoured the
ratchet marks and the other did not. A session of green advisories ending at a
commit wall teaches an agent that the advisory means nothing.

So the pairing is the test. Each case stages one edit and asks both surfaces,
and the assertion is on the pair: green here has to mean green there, and the
function the advisory names has to be the function the gate refuses for.

What deliberately stays different is the wording. PostToolUse runs after the
write and cannot block, so the advisory says the edit landed; the gate says
decompose before committing, because there the commit really is refused.
