"""The one way tests/e2e spawns the CLI, and the git lines every repo fixture needs.

AGENTS.md fixes the contract these tests run under: tests/e2e drives
`python -m crapkit` against a real git repo in a tmp dir and asserts through the
CLI only. Before this file, 42 copies of that four-line `subprocess.run` lived in
the test files, 23 of them different, and the differences were invisible: a file
that decoded the child as UTF-8 sat next to one that took the platform default,
with nothing to say which was deliberate.

`run_cli` keeps every one of those differences, but as a named argument. A file
binds its own contract once, at the top, with `cli_runner`:

    run_cli = cli_runner(timeout=300, encoding="utf-8", errors="replace",
                         env_extra={"CRAPKIT_OVERRIDE_REASON": None})

so what that file needs from the child process is one readable line instead of a
body to diff against 41 others. The defaults are the plainest child (platform
decoding, the inherited environment) with one policy: a run that names no timeout
waits the suite's hang bound (tests/hang_guard.py), and a miss kills the child and
fails with what it printed. Two files once bound the CLI at 30 s, and a loaded
machine failed three of their tests on a correct tree. A file may still name a
longer bound for a run that does real work.

The child inherits the parent's package selection. Development can select the
working tree with PYTHONPATH; isolated CI selects its verified wheel through
the environment's interpreter. No default here may replace that choice.

A fixture lane spells a bare `python`, which its shell finds through PATH, so the
suite's own interpreter directory goes first on the child's PATH. With another
project's virtualenv first, each nested pytest loaded that environment's
plugins, and one e2e file spent twice the CPU.
