"""The one way tests/e2e spawns the CLI, and the git lines every repo fixture needs.

AGENTS.md fixes the contract these tests run under: tests/e2e drives
`python -m crapkit` against a real git repo in a tmp dir and asserts through the
CLI only. Before this file, 42 copies of that four-line `subprocess.run` lived in
the test files, 23 of them different, and the differences were invisible: a file
that decoded the child as UTF-8 sat next to one that took the platform default,
with nothing to say which was deliberate.

`run_cli` keeps every one of those differences, but as a named argument. A file
binds its own contract once, at the top, with `cli_runner`:

    run_cli = cli_runner(timeout=300, encoding="utf-8", errors="replace",
                         env_extra={"CRAPKIT_OVERRIDE_REASON": None})

so what that file needs from the child process is one readable line instead of a
body to diff against 41 others. Nothing here is a policy: the defaults are the
plainest child (120 s, platform decoding, the inherited environment), and a file
that needs otherwise says so.

The child inherits the parent's package selection. Development can select the
working tree with PYTHONPATH; isolated CI selects its verified wheel through
the environment's interpreter. No default here may replace that choice.
