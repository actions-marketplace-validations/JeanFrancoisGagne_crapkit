"""The watch loop driven to a known end.

`--cycles N` is the seam that makes the loop testable at all. The unbounded
default only ever ends in a signal, and a watcher killed with SIGTERM proves
nothing about its exit code and writes no coverage on the way out.

Three runs, no wall-clock waits anywhere: a real subprocess that stops on its
own, an in-process run whose only stub is the clock (the file is touched during
the poll's own sleep, and the rescore that fires is a real child process), and
an interrupt during that same sleep.
