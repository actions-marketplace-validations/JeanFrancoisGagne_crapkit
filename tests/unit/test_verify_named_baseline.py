"""`verify --baseline ID` refusals say what was named and what would have worked.

Naming a run is the deliberate act that bypasses the taint rule, so the answer
to a run that cannot serve is about THAT run: which it is, why it cannot be a
baseline, and which runs can. "No trusted scored baseline, run coverage first"
is true of an empty store; said of a store holding a trusted run 9 and a failed
verify 10 (#27), it sent the operator to a full coverage run when
`--baseline 9` was the answer.
