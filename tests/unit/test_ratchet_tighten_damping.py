"""Tightening a mark claims the code improved. The same commit measured twice cannot have.

Reported against a Python repo whose coverage attribution races: one function
measured CRAP 20.0 on run 9 and 72.0 on run 10, same sha, same bytes. A mark
seeded at the pessimistic value is pulled down by the lucky run and fails the
unlucky one, so an unstable input became an unstable gate. These pin the damping
seam: a measurement that jumped between two runs of one commit holds its mark.
