"""One file, two functions, one name: the records and the line that names them.

Until 0.4.2 this was a loss. The ratchet keyed a mark on `(path, long_name)`, so
one function under a colliding name was marked and gated and the others were
neither. `keys` ends that: the first keeps the bare name and the rest take a
`#N` ordinal counted in file order, so every twin carries its own mark.

The stderr line stays, as information rather than a warning. A `#2` turning up
in a committed `crapkit-ratchet.tsv` is otherwise unexplained, and the shape is
ordinary in two languages at once. C: both arms of an `#ifdef` fork are
textually present, so a platform shim defines `plat_open` twice in one file and
lizard reports both. Python: a method's long_name carries no class, so two
classes in one module with an `__init__` collide.

Anonymous functions are exempt from the line. lizard names every one of them
`(anonymous)`, so a file with two arrow callbacks collides by construction and
the line would name nothing a reader could act on. They take the same ordinal
keys as any other twin, and `keys.handles` already addresses them as
`(anonymous)#N`.
