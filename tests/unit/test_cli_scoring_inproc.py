"""`inventory`, `coverage` and `rescore` driven in-process over a tmp repo.

These three commands were 43% covered by tests/unit: every rule they enforce was
pinned one layer down (score_rows, lane_order, overlay_stale_coverage) and the
commands that compose those rules were reached only from tests/e2e, at a process
each. `main(argv)` is the same entry point `python -m crapkit` uses, so the
assertions here are the ones an e2e test makes — exit code, stdout, stderr,
store rows — for a hundredth of the wall time.

Every test asserts through the command. Nothing here reaches into a helper's
return value.
