"""The coverage join, at the two places speed and correctness meet.

_finish builds a ScoredRow positionally, which is only safe while the inventory
row's fields ARE the scored row's first fields in the same order and cognitive
and occurrence trail both. That is a contract between two NamedTuples nothing else states,
so it is stated here.

The span join indexes each path's candidates by start line before searching,
because 91.5% of joinable rows hit a candidate declaring their exact start and
the scan behind them was 936,818 pairwise comparisons on the consumer repo. An index may
only ever be a faster route to the same winner, so the whole join is diffed
against the pre-index scan, kept verbatim below as its oracle.
