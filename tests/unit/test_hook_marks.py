"""Two mark rules, on purpose, and the line between them.

The commit gate judges staged blobs. A blob has no coverage, so a staged
violation has no CRAP — only a ccn. `hook-precommit` therefore exempts on the
EXISTENCE of a (path, long_name) mark: the repo signed for this function, and a
commit is not the moment to reopen that.

`rescore --gate` and `verify` both hold a scored row, so they keep the numeric
rule: at or under the recorded mark it is carried debt, past it the mark rose
and the verdict fails. Those two are `_unmarked_breaches`, and this file pins
that the new hook rule did not leak into them.
