"""The twin-key note is printed by the parent process, never by an analysis worker.

`_reconfigure_streams` makes the CLI's pipes UTF-8 on Windows, where a pipe
otherwise gets the legacy codepage. A `ProcessPoolExecutor` child builds its own
`sys.stderr` over the inherited handle and never sees that reconfigure, so a
note printed from `analyze_one` reached a UTF-8 reader as cp1252 bytes (#31: the
em dash arrived as 0x97 on a stream whose other lines were UTF-8). Workers
return records; the parent is the only process that says anything.
