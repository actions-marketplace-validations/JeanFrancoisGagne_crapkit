"""Pure-core replay of recorded real lizard output against a committed golden export.

The recording (raw_std.json / raw_mod.json) was captured once from lizard over
the committed fixture sources; the golden pins the merge+snapshot+export
pipeline byte-for-byte. Pipeline behavior changes fail here; upstream lizard
format drift fails the e2e lane instead, and re-recording is an explicit,
reviewed act.
