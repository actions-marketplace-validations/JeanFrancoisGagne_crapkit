"""What the CLI refuses, and what it accepts, at the boundary where argv arrives.

Every test here drives `main(argv)` over the in-process repo. The bugs behind
them share one shape: an argument the parser typed but nobody checked reached a
slice, a path match or an `open()` and produced an answer instead of a refusal.
A `--top` of 0 handed out an item and locked it; the same 0 printed a clean bill
of health over three duplicate pairs; a file argument spelled `./src/a.ts` or as
the absolute path a shell just completed routed to no scope and scored nothing.
