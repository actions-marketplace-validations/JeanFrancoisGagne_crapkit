"""The bare identifier a long name opens with, in every language crapkit reads.

lizard prints the signature it parsed, and only some of its readers spell the
parameter list with parentheses. Python gives `classify( score , limit = 1 )`
and shell gives `classify()`, so cutting at the first `(` found the name. Rust
gives `route cmd : & Cmd` and Go gives `Classify n int`, where the parameters
follow the name with nothing but a space, and that cut handed the whole
signature back: `brief src/lib.rs route` was rejected as an unknown name, and
the packet's `handle` read `route cmd : & Cmd`.

The rule is the leading token of whatever precedes the parameter list. Every
parenthesised language keeps the name it had, including the `::`-qualified
C++ and Java forms and an Objective-C selector's trailing colon, because none
of those holds a space.

Anonymity is unmoved: `(anonymous)` and `(anonymous) ( z )` both open with the
parenthesis, so an empty bare name is still the one test for it.
