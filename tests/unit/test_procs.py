"""A lane's timeout has to kill the suite, not just the shell in front of it.

`shell=True` makes the shell the child and the test runner a grandchild.
subprocess.run's timeout killed the shell alone, so `timeout_seconds` - the
consumer's only guard against a hung suite - raised the ToolError on schedule
and left the suite running with nothing waiting on it. The lane log even said
"killed". Nothing was.

So both lane spawns go through procs.run_bounded, which streams into the log
file while still killing the whole process group on the deadline. The log is a
real file: it needs no reader, so streaming costs the deadline nothing.
