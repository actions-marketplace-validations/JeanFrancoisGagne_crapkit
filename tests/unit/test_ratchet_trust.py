"""Seed and prune pick their run through verify's trust rule.

Reported against 0.4.2 (#16). `_latest_full_run` took the newest run whose kind
was coverage or verify and never read the verdict, so `ratchet seed` signed
marks from a FAILED verify — the same scores `verify` refuses as a comparison
point, and a failed verify can carry them from a red tree.
