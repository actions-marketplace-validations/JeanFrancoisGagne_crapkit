"""What a fresh reader copies out of README.md and the handbook, pinned.

Every claim here was measured on a throwaway repo before it was written down:
the doctor transcript a clean config prints, the payload `next-item` emits, the
exit code git reports for a refused commit, the npm error a bare provider
install raises, the PowerShell switch arm that scores nothing. The assertions
compare the page against the code that produces it, so a transcript nobody can
reproduce fails here rather than costing a reader a failed command.
