"""A pytest or vitest lane with no `results_artifact` gets a doctor WARN (#26).

Two of verify's checks read the lane's junit: the crashed-worker trust check
("a run nobody finished is not a measurement") and no-new-failures (exit 8).
A lane that declares no results file never reaches either, and nothing said
so: doctor reported no problems for a configuration in which a dead xdist
worker still yielded a full, trusted baseline. WARN, never FAIL: the lane still
measures coverage exactly as it did.
