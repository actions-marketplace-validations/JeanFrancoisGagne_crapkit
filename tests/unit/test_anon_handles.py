"""The ordinal handle: a name for a function lizard could not name.

A file's anonymous functions all print as `(anonymous)`, so the only string a
session could pass back was the start line — and a start line is invalidated by
any edit above it, including the decomposition the session was told to make. The
handle counts positions instead: `(anonymous)#2` is the file's second anonymous
function, whatever line it has drifted to.

Every seam here is pure or a tmp SQLite file, so the resolution rules can be
argued about without a repo, a lane or a git history.
