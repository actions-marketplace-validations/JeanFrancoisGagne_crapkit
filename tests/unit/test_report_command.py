"""`report` as a subcommand: the parser entry, the handler it resolves to, and
the path it writes.

The dispatch half is already covered generically by test_cli_lazy_families, which
parametrizes over the parser's own choices. What is pinned here is the part that
generic test cannot see: the flags the command takes, the default output path,
and that the page it writes is the renderer's output rather than a second one.
