"""The two numbers the Bash fallback runs on, pinned to every page that prints them.

`crapkit claude-hook` judges a Bash write off the working tree: the changed
*.py files whose mtime sits inside `_FRESH_WINDOW_SECONDS`, at most
`_MAX_COMMAND_FILES` of them. Seven pages print those two numbers in prose, so a
tuning change to either constant would leave all seven wrong and green. This
reads the numbers back out of each page and compares them with the module.

A page that names the window has to name the cap too: the reader who learns
"12 seconds" and not "25 files" is told half the rule.
