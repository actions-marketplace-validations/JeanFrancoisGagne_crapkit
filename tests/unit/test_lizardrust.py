"""Hand-counted Rust complexity, and the reader-resolution mechanics behind it.

Every number below was counted by hand from the snippet above it, never read off
a run. The convention under test: base 1, plus one per match arm whose pattern is
not the bare wildcard, plus lizard's existing conditions (if, for, while, where,
&&, ||, ?). `match` itself costs nothing.

test_stock_reader_scores_the_seven_arm_match_two is the retirement signal. It
pins the upstream defect, so it fails the day lizard fixes #494; that is when
src/crapkit/lizardrust.py gets deleted rather than repaired.
