"""The watch command's shell: what one poll rescores, what the banner promises,
and how the loop is bounded. The mtime diffing behind it is pure and lives in
test_contexts_and_watch.py.

run_owned is recorded rather than run: the argv IS the contract here (the
rescore has to leave the watcher's own process, so a half-saved syntax error
cannot take the loop down with it), and a real child would only re-prove what
tests/e2e/test_watch_cycles_e2e.py proves against a real repo.
