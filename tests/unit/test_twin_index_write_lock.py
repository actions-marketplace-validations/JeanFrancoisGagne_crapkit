"""Storing a run's shingle index does not lock the rest of crapkit out.

The first brief on a run writes about 38 MB of index into the store on a large
consumer repo. Two things kept every other crapkit process waiting on that write:

- At SQLite's default 2 MB page cache the insert spills to the file before it
  commits, and a spill takes the exclusive lock. A reader polling during a
  9.4 s write was locked out for 8.8 s of it, longer than the 5 s any crapkit
  command waits before failing with "database is locked".
- Sorting and encoding 1.55 M postings under the write lock kept every other
  writer waiting for all of it, where copying them in from a temp table built
  beforehand holds the lock for about a third of the time.

Both are mechanism tests: a second connection that never waits tries to read,
or to write, at the moment that matters.
