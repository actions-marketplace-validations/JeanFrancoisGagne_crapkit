"""The two pyproject keys that keep the CLI entry points measured.

tests/e2e runs most CLI calls inside the pytest worker, but the files that bind
cli_runner(spawn=True), and every Python child crapkit starts, run in processes
of their own. What carries coverage into those children used to be
pytest-cov's own `pytest-cov.pth`; pytest-cov 7.0.0 deleted it ("Dropped support
for subprocesses measurement") and the job is now coverage's
`[run] patch = subprocess`, added in coverage 7.10.

Neither half fails loudly on its own. Drop the patch and pytest-cov 7 measures
no child at all — `cli/admin.py` reads 0/498 statements and every `cmd_*` a diff
touches trips the gate at 0% coverage. Keep the patch but let an older coverage
in and it answers the unknown key with a CoverageWarning that pytest-cov files
under `once::CoverageWarning`, which is the same silence one warning louder.

This asserts the pair stays consistent. It does not prove the mechanism works:
that is a lane run, and the numbers it produced are in the pyproject comment.
