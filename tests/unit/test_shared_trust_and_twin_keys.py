"""Where the 0.4.3 field fixes meet: one trust rule, one key.

Three fixes landed against run history and the ratchet key in the same release,
and each was measured on its own branch. These pin the seams BETWEEN them, which
no branch could see:

- `ratchet seed` skips a failed verify (#16) and verify's tighten damping (#15)
  reads the same commit's earlier run. Two readers of run history, so they need
  one answer to "is this run a measurement": `store.is_trusted`.
- The damping compares a mark against what an earlier run measured (#15), and a
  mark is now keyed by twin ordinal (#17). Both sides of that comparison have to
  be the same key or the numbers belong to different functions.
- The git merge driver merges marks files (0.3.x) that now carry `#N` keys (#17).
