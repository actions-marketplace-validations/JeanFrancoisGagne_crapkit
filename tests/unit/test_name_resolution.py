"""One NAME rule for `brief` and `explain`: exact first, the fragment second.

The two commands read the same string out of the same payload and disagreed
about it. `brief` matched only the whole long name or the whole bare name, so
`route` picked `route`. `explain` ran a SQL `LIKE '%route%'`, so the same string
returned `route`, `route_chain` and `route_num` and printed three trajectories
for a question about one function.

Exact first fixes the collision without taking the fragment away: a name that
IS a function's name resolves to that function, and a name that is nobody's
still finds everything holding it. A repo whose names nest — `route` inside
`route_chain` — is the common case, not the exotic one.
