"""One tokenization per file, with both ccn columns falling out of it.

Modified ccn used to cost a second full lizard pass over the same bytes. It is
not a different reading of the file: lizard's modified extension adds +1 on a
switch/match opener and -1 on each arm and touches nothing else, so

    ccn_mod == ccn_std + (switch openers - case arms)

The delta is counted in pass 1 and the second pass is gone. ccn = min(std, mod)
feeds the gate, so the values pinned here are the contract, measured against the
two-pass implementation they replaced.
