"""The dev extra is the entire install contract for CI.

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` installs with `pip install -e ".[dev]"` and nothing
else, so a pytest plugin the committed fixture lanes need has to be declared
there or every test job dies before it reaches an assertion. That is exactly
what happened on run 33225190806: `tests/fixtures/mini_repo` declared a lane
that shelled out to `pytest pylib -n 2 ...` (mini_repo now passes `-n 0`, and
`tests/fixtures/mini_repo_xdist` keeps `-n 2`; both still need xdist),
pytest-xdist was a manual side install the docs asked for and CI never did, and
all six test jobs (three Python versions on ubuntu-latest and windows-latest
alike) failed with `unrecognized arguments: -n`.

A fixture lane resolves `python` from PATH rather than from `sys.executable`. A
developer whose PATH python carried xdist once saw the suite pass from a venv
that lacked it, while CI, with no second interpreter, broke first. The e2e child
environment now puts the suite's own interpreter first on PATH, so a fixture
lane runs the interpreter whose install this contract checks.
