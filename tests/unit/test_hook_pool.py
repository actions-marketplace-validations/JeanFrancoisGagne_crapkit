"""Where the hook stops analyzing staged blobs serially and pays for a pool.

Every worker a pool starts re-imports lizard, and that import is the whole cost
of a small pool. Measured on this box (9 reps per point, medians): 4 staged
files cost 17ms serial against 120ms pooled, 8 cost 52 against 158, 12 cost 112
against 175. Serial and pool only cross at 16 (178 against 191), so that is
where the threshold sits.

The pool is counted, never started: the point of the test is which arm the hook
takes, and a real ProcessPoolExecutor would add a second of spawn to prove it.
