"""The warm path: what a run does when the cache already answers every file.

On the consumer repo's 14k files a fully-warm inventory spent its time re-deriving things
it already had. Two of those are pinned here:

  re-stamping    every cached row was rebuilt with `_replace(path=...)` even when
                 the path had not moved (0.22 s of a 1.59 s run)
  file identity  every file was opened and read to the end to find out its
                 content had not changed (0.82 s of the same run)

Both are cache mechanics, so the tests check the mechanism (rows reused by
identity, files not opened) and never the clock.
