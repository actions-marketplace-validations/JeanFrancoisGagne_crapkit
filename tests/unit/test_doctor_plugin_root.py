"""`crapkit doctor --plugin-root PATH`: does this installed plugin match this CLI?

The plugin and the CLI ship apart. The plugin carries a `hooks.json` that spawns
`crapkit claude-hook --protocol 1`, and a machine whose CLI predates that
subcommand answers with an argparse usage dump on every edit. Nothing on either
side notices: the hook is registered, it runs, and its exit 2 is read as a
finding. This is the handshake that names the drift instead.

Two numbers are compared and nothing else: the manifest's `version` against the
running CLI's, and every `--protocol` the hook handlers name against the one
protocol this CLI answers. Agreement is silence, because a check that prints on
success is a check people stop reading.

The check never reads `crapkit.toml`. A plugin cache is not a repo, and the
question "is my plugin behind my CLI" has no repo in it.
