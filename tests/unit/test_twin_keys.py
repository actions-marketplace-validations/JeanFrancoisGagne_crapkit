"""Same name, one file: every twin gets its own ratchet key.

The reporter's shape, on a repo of 2,768 scored functions: a module holding
several dataclasses, each with its own `__post_init__`. A mark and a gate keyed
on `(path, long_name)`, so one twin owned the key and the others were neither
marked nor gated. Any of them could grow past every ceiling and no gate ever
fired. Three collisions in one repo, twice on `__post_init__` and once on
`size`.

The key now carries an ordinal counted in start order: the first twin keeps the
bare name, the second answers to `name#2`, the third to `name#3`. Bare-is-first
is what makes it free to adopt — every mark recorded before it already reads as
twin #1, so no committed TSV needs rewriting.
