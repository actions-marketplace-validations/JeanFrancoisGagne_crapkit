"""`coverage --reuse-artifacts` after a failed lane, driven in-process.

Every assertion is what the operator reads: the exit code, the stderr line,
the runs the store holds. The template's lanes run `python -c pass`, which
writes nothing, so a plain `coverage` over seeded artifacts is the failed
attempt this file is about.
