"""What each position of a scored run IS.

`_scored_run` used to return a bare 8-tuple. `coverage` unpacked it dropping
position 5 and `verify` dropped 7 and 8, both with `_`, so the only record of
what any position held was the order of the names in the unpack line. Two of
them are failures of different kinds: position 4 is the lanes that FAILED to
run, position 5 is the tests that failed inside a lane that ran. `coverage`
named position 4 `failures` and never read position 5.

These tests pin the field names and which value each one carries. The lane run
is stubbed: the names are the subject, not lizard or git.
