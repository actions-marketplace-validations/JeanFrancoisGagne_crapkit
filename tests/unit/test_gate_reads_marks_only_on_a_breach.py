"""`rescore --gate` reads the marks file only when a changed function breached.

A mark can only pardon a breach, so a gate with none has no question for the
marks file. Reading it anyway cost a clean check_gate several seconds on a large
consumer repo, where proving legacy ratchet keys scans every stored run. The
pre-commit hook already skips the read on a clean commit, and this is the same
rule.

The trade is the hook's too: a clean gate no longer reports a marks file it
cannot parse. The next gate that breaches still reads the file and refuses it.
