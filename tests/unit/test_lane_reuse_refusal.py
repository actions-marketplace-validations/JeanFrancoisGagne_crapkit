"""The reuse door after a failed attempt, at the lane runner and the fold.

`_run_attempts` refuses the artifact a run did not rewrite (0.4.12). Reuse then
read the same file back on the next command and scored it. The refusal now
carries the modification time of the file the attempt left, the fold persists
it through the stamps file, and reuse refuses the file while its modification
time still equals the refused one; a salvage rewritten after the failure
carries a new one and reuses.
