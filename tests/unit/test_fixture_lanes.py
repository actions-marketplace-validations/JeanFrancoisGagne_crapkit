"""The committed fixture lanes start no machinery their tests never measure.

Every e2e run that measures mini_repo started its py lane as `pytest -n 2`: two
xdist workers for a two-test package, 0.77 s of wall against 0.33 s with no
workers. Under the suite's own coverage run each lane's Python child also
started coverage, 76-81 ms apiece, measuring code no test reads. Two hooks start
it: coverage's own, which pytest-cov 7 relies on and COVERAGE_PROCESS_CONFIG
arms, and pytest-cov 6's, which COV_CORE_DATAFILE arms. Each skips the child when
its variable is empty. One test is about xdist fragments combining, and it alone
keeps two workers, in its own fixture file.
