"""The function-naming rules live in keys.py, beside the twin keys they feed,
and one selector resolver answers a NAME for every command that takes one.

Three resolvers answered the same NAME before. `brief` resolved in cli/queue.py
and answered a bare twin name with the worst twin. `explain` resolved in
store.py and answered it with the first. `claims release` matched through a
copy of the exact-name predicate. store.py and analyze.py imported the packet
formatter to reach the rules, and keys.py spelled `(anonymous)` by hand.
