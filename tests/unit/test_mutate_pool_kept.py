"""The worktree pool is kept between runs, and every run starts from a tree that
holds exactly what a fresh checkout of the repo's HEAD would hold.

Real git here, unlike test_mutate_pool.py: what is under test is what a git
worktree does to a directory across two runs, and a fake add that makes a folder
would go green whether the re-prepare works or not. The repos are two files.

A fresh set of four checkouts costs 30.6 s on a 31,459-file tree; re-preparing
the kept set costs 0.46 s. That is the whole point of the pool, so the tests
that matter are the ones saying the reused tree is not a cheaper LIE: the last
run's mutant is gone, the last suite's artifacts are gone, and a commit made
between two runs is there.
