"""PowerShell enters the file universe as a cc-only language, on a reader lizard lacks.

Two constants admit it — `SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES` and `LANGUAGE_EXTENSIONS` — and no
third. Pester names its test files `Foo.Tests.ps1` beside the source, which no
default exclude claims, and crapkit does not invent one: `**/*_test.go` was safe
because the Go toolchain enforces that suffix, while `Deploy.Tests.ps1` is a name
a repo is free to give production code. The escape hatch is the `[exclude]` table
a user already has, and the test below proves it reaches these files.

The measurement is the other half of admission, twice over. lizard answers
`(get_reader_for(filename) or CLikeReader)`, and CLikeReader finds C-shaped
functions in a .ps1 file, so an unregistered corpus reports plausible wrong
numbers. And lizard reads source with `io.open(path, 'r')`, letting the machine's
locale decide the encoding — Windows PowerShell writes cp1252 by default, so the
same file produced two different function names on two machines and the ratchet
keys on the name.
