"""`verify`, `test-scoped` and `hook-precommit` driven in-process over a tmp repo.

verify assembles a verdict out of parts that were each unit-tested one layer down
— pick_baseline, unstable_marks, stamp_conflict, closable_claims, evaluate — and
the assembly itself was reached only from tests/e2e, at a process per case. That
left 33 of the file's 49 functions with no unit test at all, the exit-code map
included.

`main(argv)` is the same entry point `python -m crapkit` uses. Everything here is
asserted through it: exit code, stdout, stderr, and what the store and the marks
file hold afterwards.
