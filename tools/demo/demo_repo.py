"""Build the throwaway git repo the demo runs against.

The committed fixture under `fixture/` is the final tree and carries no `.git`,
so every run starts from nothing. `history/` holds the earlier version of the
two files that change twice; replaying the stages gives the worklist real churn
to rank on, which a single-commit repo cannot (every file weighs 1.0 there, so
the ranking is ccn order).

Identity and dates are fixed because the commit sha reaches the frames: the
demo prints `run 1 @ <sha>` and two runs have to print the same one.
