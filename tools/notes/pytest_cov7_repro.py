"""Measure what pytest-cov 7 stopped measuring, four ways.

When this ran, every `cmd_*` in `src/crapkit/cli/` was reached through
`subprocess.run` by tests/e2e and by nothing else, so whether the CLI was
measured at all came down to whether coverage follows a child process. The
file it runs, test_init_doctor_e2e.py, still spawns its CLI calls, so the
counts hold. pytest-cov followed children itself until
7.0.0 ("Dropped support for subprocesses measurement"); the job now belongs to
coverage's own `[run] patch = ["subprocess"]`, added in coverage 7.10.

This script builds two throwaway venvs, one per pytest-cov pin, and runs one
e2e file in each of them twice: once with the patch key on and once with it
off. The four statement counts for `src/crapkit/cli/admin.py` go to
`pytest_cov7_repro.json` beside this file, with the exact versions that
produced them. `tests/unit/test_notes_contract.py` reads that JSON and fails
when the published note disagrees with it.

The patch key is toggled through `COVERAGE_RCFILE`, which points at a temporary
`.coveragerc` written under the work directory. The repository tree is never
edited, so a run that dies halfway leaves nothing behind to clean up.

    python tools/notes/pytest_cov7_repro.py            # throwaway work dir
    python tools/notes/pytest_cov7_repro.py --workdir D:/scratch/cov7

The run costs two `pip install -e .[dev]` and four serial e2e runs. It needs
network for the pins and about ten minutes.
