"""Render one pull-request comment out of crapkit's own JSON payloads.

The composite action at the repository root runs `crapkit coverage --json`,
`crapkit verify --json` and `crapkit worklist --json` in the consumer's
checkout and hands the three files here. This module turns them into the
markdown the action posts, and into the request body `gh api` sends, so the
escaping is json.dumps' problem and never a shell quoting question.

It reads the payloads and nothing else: no git, no network, no clock. Run it on
three saved files and you get the byte-identical comment the job would post,
which is how the rendering in README's action section was produced.
