# Releasing crapkit

The version is always an explicit argument. Run one stage at a time from the release checkout. Stage 1 requires clean `main` that includes current `origin/main`; local preparation commits may remain unpublished. Stage 2a creates the local tag and runs the contract tests. Publishing requires that tag at the same clean HEAD and a new passing full `verify` row recorded by the verify stage. A zero process exit without that ledger row is refused. Nothing is pushed before that proof passes.

Stage 1 regenerates documentation after reinstalling the bumped version. It includes the generated `SECURITY.md` support table in the release commit. It measures nothing: the verify stage runs the one full py lane a release needs. Stage 2a checks generated guidance against the tagged version.

The verification ledger must record passing tests for the full Python lane, which
runs both unit and end-to-end suites. Publication requires exit code zero, no test
failures, at least one executed test, valid skipped counts and both coverage and
test-result digests. A regression verdict that accepts unchanged failures does
not satisfy this release requirement.

```
python tools/release/release.py check VERSION
python tools/release/release.py plan VERSION
python tools/release/release.py run stage1 VERSION
python tools/release/release.py run stage2a VERSION
python tools/release/release.py run verify VERSION
python tools/release/release.py run stage2b VERSION
python tools/release/release.py run registry VERSION
python tools/release/release.py run glama VERSION
python tools/release/release.py verify VERSION
```

Keep `run verify` in its own background process when the calling tool has a shorter deadline than the suite. `plan` and `run --dry-run` print commands without changing files or contacting publication services.

Run `verify` through its stage, never as the bare command `plan` prints. The stage
stamps a run-id watermark before it starts and publication requires a passing run
above that watermark. `python -m crapkit verify` on its own stamps nothing, so a
run you watched pass is refused later with a message about test evidence.

After a passing verify, the stage runs `ratchet seed` and `ratchet prune` against
that verify run. A green verify also tightens and drops marks on its own, so the
stage compares against the marks it read before the verify started. When verify,
seed and prune change `crapkit-ratchet.tsv`, the release commit lacks marks its own
tree earns. The stage puts the committed file back, saves the computed one as
`.crapkit/release-marks-VERSION.tsv`, stops, and publication stays refused. The
refusal prints the commands that carry the saved file into the release commit:

```
git tag -d vVERSION
cp .crapkit/release-marks-VERSION.tsv crapkit-ratchet.tsv
git add -- crapkit-ratchet.tsv
git commit --amend --no-edit
```

Then rerun stage 2a and verify. `git add` comes first because `git commit -- PATH`
refuses a marks file the release commit does not track yet.

## Preflight: prove the environment before anything is pushed

Every fault in the 0.7.2 release fired after PyPI and the GitHub release were
already public, because nothing checked the machine first.

`check VERSION` is stage 1's first command, so the chain stops before it builds or
pushes anything. Besides the version surfaces and the changelog heading, it reads
the two rows marked `check` below. Confirm the two rows marked `you` yourself:
`check` never looks at PATH or at `gh`.
Each takes seconds. A missing credential or gh login shows up only after the push;
a wrong PATH python or a missing build or twine stops the release before it.

| Check | Checked by | Command | Why it bites |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The release venv is ACTIVATED | you | `which python` names this repository's `.venv` | The py lane in `crapkit.toml` runs a bare `python`, taken from PATH, not the interpreter that launched this script. Launching by absolute path is not enough. A PATH `python` without the dev extra fails the verify stage: nothing is pushed, and the release waits for a rerun. |
| The release interpreter imports build and twine | `check` | `python -c "import build, twine"` | Stage 2b runs `python -m build` and `python -m twine` through the interpreter that launched this script, and it builds before the push. |
| PyPI credentials reach Twine | `check` | `TWINE_USERNAME` and `TWINE_PASSWORD` are set, or the token is in keyring | Twine 7 skips the named `.pypirc` entry whenever `--repository-url` is passed, and that flag is a fixed anti-redirect control. A `.pypirc` alone authenticates nothing. |
| `gh` is authenticated | you | `gh auth status` | Publishing uses `gh`, and every readback now sends the same credential. GitHub's Pages API answers 404, not 403, to an anonymous reader. |

A failed `check` row prints its line and `check` exits 1. The first line names only
the tools that are missing:

```
the release interpreter cannot import build, twine; stage 2b runs `python -m build` and `python -m twine` before the push, so install build, twine into the environment that runs release.py
no PyPI credential is reachable: twine ignores .pypirc when --repository-url is passed, so set TWINE_USERNAME and TWINE_PASSWORD, or store the token in keyring
```

Set up the release venv once. `.venv/` is ignored by this repository:

```
python -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -e ".[dev]" build twine
```

On Windows use `.venv\Scripts\python.exe`, and activate the venv in the shell that
runs the release so PATH resolves `python` to it.

## Expect a rerun after each publication

PyPI's version JSON and GitHub's release API both take seconds to serve what was
just written, so the read straight after a publish usually misses. Each action now
re-reads for up to 55 seconds (12 reads, 5 seconds apart) before giving up, which
costs nothing and republishes nothing. PyPI outlasted the earlier 15-second window
on both 0.7.3 and 0.7.4.

If it still misses, the stage records the action as pending and stops. Rerun the
same stage once the surface answers. A pending entry means "unconfirmed", never
"failed", so check the surface itself before reaching for the recovery procedure.
The 0.7.2 release ran before this retry existed and paid a stage rerun for every
artifact, six in all.


## Build once, then publish

Stage 2b builds a wheel and a source archive into `.crapkit/release-dist/` and runs `twine check` before any push. It records each filename and SHA256 digest in `.crapkit/release-receipt.json`, alongside the HEAD, version, contract proof and verification run. A retry rechecks those local bytes and never rebuilds a recorded pair. Missing, changed, extra or redirected artifacts refuse publication. Ordinary `dist/` output is separate.

Publication targets are fixed to PyPI and `github.com/JeanFrancoisGagne/crapkit`, matching recovery readback. The commands pass Twine's upload URL and gh's repository or hostname explicitly, so `TWINE_REPOSITORY_URL`, `.pypirc`, `GH_REPO` and `GH_HOST` cannot redirect them. Before publishing, both resolved `origin` fetch and push URLs must name that repository using ordinary HTTPS, `git@github.com:` or `ssh://git@github.com/` syntax. Multiple URLs and SSH host aliases refuse; set an explicit canonical URL before retrying. Git keeps the admitted transport and credentials.

The first push is confirmed only when remote `main` and the release tag both equal the receipt HEAD. After that proof is recorded, retries require the same remote tag and allow `main` to advance. It reads the version-specific PyPI JSON response and GitHub release asset digests before each upload, then sends only missing files. An existing filename with different bytes is an error; it never requests an overwrite. Older GitHub assets without a digest are downloaded and hashed in bounded chunks. After every publication command, including a failed command, the stage reads back the remote result. A failed command with confirmed publication stops safely; rerun the same stage to continue.

PyPI filename digests come from its [version JSON response](https://docs.pypi.org/api/json/). GitHub publishes [asset digests and download URLs](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/releases/assets). Pages completion uses the [latest build's commit and status](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/pages/pages#get-latest-pages-build), not the POST response alone. These readbacks describe the receipt's wheel and source archive; they do not audit unrelated release assets.

## Resume a partial stage

Keep the receipt and `.crapkit/release-dist/` together, then rerun:

```
python tools/release/release.py run stage2b VERSION
```

The command repeats all clean-tree, tag and ledger checks. It reuses matching local files, reads published files again, skips matching uploads, and continues with the next missing file. The local Claude plugin update is recorded after success. An interrupted local update can run again. Registry login/publish remains its own stage. It logs in with `mcp-publisher login github --token` and the `gh auth token` value, so there is no device flow, and publishes straight after, because the registry session lasts only minutes. The echoed command shows `$(gh auth token)`, never the token. Glama's Repository admin **Sync Server** action stays manual, and is the only step in the chain no command performs: `run glama VERSION` prints that step and runs nothing.

Pages can finish after the command stops. A `queued` or `building` status at the release commit asks you to wait and rerun; it does not send a second POST. A `built` result at that commit completes the stage. A later `errored` result at that commit proves the build ended and permits one new request on the next invocation. A build whose commit does not carry the release commit cannot confirm this release; a build at a later commit on main that carries it does, by the same ancestry test `verify` applies.

## Resolve an unknown outcome

The receipt records a pending action before sending its command. If the command or readback fails and the remote result is still unknown, a retry reads again but does not repeat that action. A transient 404, empty result or timeout is not proof that the upload never happened.

If readback later finds the expected bytes, rerunning stage 2b clears that pending action and continues automatically. If the original request definitively failed before publishing, use this manual recovery procedure:

1. Confirm with the provider's upload or request history that the original request has ended and the named file or release is absent. Wait for pending requests and caches to settle. Preserve that evidence.
2. Back up `.crapkit/release-receipt.json`. Remove only the matching string from its `pending` array, such as `pypi:crapkit-VERSION-py3-none-any.whl` or `github:create`. Leave the HEAD, version, artifact digests and verification fields unchanged.
3. Rerun stage 2b. It reads the remote state again before issuing any missing upload. A digest mismatch still refuses.

Do not clear pending entries merely to suppress a refusal. Restore lost local artifacts from the original checked bytes; rebuilding an existing receipt's version is not a recovery path. Keep one release stage active per checkout. A new HEAD, changed tag or later failed verification requires fixing that condition and rerunning the relevant proof stage.
## Credentials and secondary listings

Install `build` and `twine` into the Python environment that runs the release
script. Check GitHub authentication with `gh auth status` and confirm access to
`JeanFrancoisGagne/crapkit` before the release starts.

Put `claude` on the release process's PATH. The script resolves each command
through a PATHEXT-aware lookup, so an npm `claude.CMD` shim now works where a bare
`claude` once died with WinError 2: Windows `CreateProcess` searches PATH but
appends only `.exe`. That failure used to land after PyPI and the GitHub release
were public. Confirm with `claude --version` from the same shell.

Twine receives an explicit PyPI upload URL. With Twine 7, that skips the named
`.pypirc` repository entry, including its credentials, so a populated `.pypirc`
authenticates nothing here. Supply credentials through Twine's supported
environment variables or keyring in the release process. Keep them out of command
arguments, logs and committed files; do not remove the fixed upload URL to make
authentication work.

The refusal reads `NonInteractive: Credential not found for API token`, and it
arrives after the push, with `main` and the tag already public. Check the
credential in preflight instead.

After stage 2b and the MCP Registry stage, check every distribution route:

| Route | Source and confirmation |
| --- | --- |
| PyPI | The release receipt's wheel and source archive hashes match the version JSON response. |
| GitHub release | The tag names the verified commit, notes match the changelog, and asset hashes match PyPI. |
| Website | `verify` compares the newest Pages build against the tagged commit and requires status `built`. Open the landing page and handbook. |
| GitHub Action and pre-commit | The release tag includes `action.yml` and `.pre-commit-hooks.yaml`; README examples use that tag. |
| Local CLI | Stage 1 updates only its selected Python environment. Upgrade the intended user CLI with its owning installer, read its resolved executable and version, and run `crapkit doctor --plugin-root` against installed plugins. |
| Claude Code plugin | Refresh its registered marketplace, update the user-scope plugin, read back its version and check `doctor --plugin-root`. Existing sessions need a restart to apply the update. |
| Codex plugin | Refresh its registered marketplace, install the current plugin with the supported manager, and check its listed version and explicit installed plugin root. Verify its three skills and MCP configuration. |
| MCP Registry | The canonical server name has the new version and matching PyPI package. A search on a cold registry cache took 78 to 87 s, so `verify` gives registry reads 120 s where every other read gets 20 s. |
| Glama | `verify` reads the server page and requires the README action pin to name this release's tag. Until the sync runs it reports an earlier revision. Use the Repository admin **Sync Server** action after the GitHub release exists, then confirm build and tool schema, and correct stale profile text separately. |

After publication, refresh the clients' marketplace snapshots before updating their
installed copies. Stage 2b invokes Claude's plugin update; it does not perform the
Codex commands below:

```sh
claude plugin marketplace update crapkit
claude plugin update crapkit@crapkit --scope user
claude plugin list --json

codex plugin marketplace upgrade crapkit --json
codex plugin add crapkit@crapkit --json
codex plugin list --marketplace crapkit --json
```

The Codex marketplace is registered once with
`codex plugin marketplace add https://github.com/JeanFrancoisGagne/crapkit.git`.
Use the supported managers to refresh installations; do not edit their caches.
Check that the registered source is the canonical repository and that its current
revision and installed version match the release. Run `crapkit doctor --plugin-root PATH`
against each installed plugin using the intended global CLI, then start a fresh MCP
session and confirm initialize reports the release version and tools/list returns
twelve tools. Doctor's no-path default checks Claude Code's cache, so pass the Codex
installed root explicitly. See the [client upgrade guide](../../docs/upgrading.md#plugin-and-mcp-clients).

These checks do not reload existing clients. Restart existing Claude Code sessions
to apply its plugin update, and start a new Codex task to load updated skills and
tools. The advisory hook instructions configure Claude Code's
PostToolUse event; the Codex installation check covers skills and MCP.

Glama profile text does not necessarily follow the README. Check its tool count
and write behavior against the current MCP definitions. Do not use **Build and
Release** to force an automatic version number while a synchronized release is
pending.

Finally, inspect the release commit's CI jobs and repository activity. A queued
job has not passed, and an upload command's exit code does not replace readback.
