"""Bump, publish and verify crapkit's version surfaces from one table.

Seven strings in five files say which version this is (pyproject, the package,
three README lines, the plugin manifest, the registry manifest twice), and a
release then has to reach six places (git tag, PyPI, GitHub release, plugin,
Pages, the MCP registry, plus Glama's sync). Eight releases re-scripted that
chain by hand and the surfaces drifted once. The table below is the one place
the surfaces are named; `check` refuses a tree whose surfaces disagree, `bump`
rewrites them all or nothing, `plan` prints the chain in the order the
contracts require, `run` executes one stage of it, and `verify` reads every
surface back through its live API rather than a cached page.

The version to release is an argument, never inferred: whether a change is a
patch or a minor is a judgment on visible behaviour, and it belongs to the
person shipping.

Stdlib only. `verify` and publishing stages read remote state. Only explicit
stage commands publish; `plan` and dry runs make no requests or writes.
