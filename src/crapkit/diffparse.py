"""Parse `git diff -U0` output into per-file changed line ranges. Pure.

Ranges are new-side. A pure deletion (zero new lines) still marks the line it
happened at, so a function shrunk by an edit is still a touched function.
Paths come from the +++ header (the new side survives renames) and decode
git's C-style quoting through the shared path decoder.

Hunk body lines are consumed by the counts the @@ header declares, never
pattern-matched: an added source line whose text starts with "++ " arrives as
"+++ <text>" and would otherwise read as a file header, repointing every later
hunk at a phantom path the gate never checks.
