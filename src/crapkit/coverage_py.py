"""Per-file coverage.py regions, context cleanup, and report completeness rules.

Requires the per-function regions coverage.py has emitted since 7.6.0 and the
start_line key from 7.13.1. Branch data is preferred and not required: the
coverage term falls back to statements, with a warning, so an artifact built by
`pytest --cov --cov-report=json` — the default CI shape, with no --cov-branch —
still scores. Function spans come from start_line and the maximum
executed/missing line, the closest thing the report offers to an end line.

This module is also the coverage.py adapter (coverage_format looks it up from a
lane's `parser`): it walks the report's "files" member through covstream's
framing, keys each file with the lane's path_prefix, takes that prefix back off
for the wrong-tree check, and owns the runner advice a refusal gives.
