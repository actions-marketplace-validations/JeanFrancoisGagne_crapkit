#                          The pass also reads a Python token's owner after

#                          followed by a module-level `if __name__`, and for
#                          one called at import right after its `def` (read as
#                          recursion). Measured on crapkit's own tree: 6 of
#                          5,258 rows. Python is the only language whose
#                          stored values move; ccn is untouched everywhere.
#                       8: shell blocks nest. `fi`, `done` and `esac` close what
#                          `if`, a loop keyword or `case` opened, `do`/`then`/`in`
#                          are free, and a bare `break` is not a labeled one, so
#                          every cached .sh and .bash record carries a cognitive
#                          score measured flat. Shell is the only language whose
#                          stored values move; ccn is untouched everywhere,
#                          shell included.
#                       7: a Rust `match` is a cognitive condition (+1 and the
#                          nesting it sits in), so every cached .rs record
#                          carries a cognitive score measured without it. Rust

# MACHINE'S LOCALE decides what a repo scores. Measured on one function,
# `function Write-Café`, written once as UTF-8 and once as cp1252, read on a
# cp1252 interpreter and on a UTF-8 one:
#
#     source     cp1252 reader        utf-8 reader

# is no word character, and the declaration stops being one. The ratchet keys on
# path::long_name, so those are three different rows for one commit, and a
# Windows developer and a Linux CI cannot see each other's baseline.
#
# utf-8 first, cp1252 second, replacement for the five bytes cp1252 leaves
# undefined. That is the whole rule and it is fixed rather than environmental:
# all four cells above read `Write-Café`. The fallback is cp1252 rather than
# latin-1 because Windows PowerShell 5.1 writes cp1252, and because latin-1
# decodes every byte and so can never say it was wrong.

# UTF-16 is NOT handled. `Out-File` and the ISE write it, and such a file
