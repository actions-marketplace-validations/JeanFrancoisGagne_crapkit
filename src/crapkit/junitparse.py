"""Parse JUnit XML into the set of failed test ids, and refuse a report that
says the run never finished. Pure.

An id is classname::name. Failures and errors count; skips and passes do not.
stdlib ElementTree is deliberate: the XML comes from the repo's own test
runner, the same trust class as the lane commands themselves. That trust runs
one way: the runner is believed about what it ran, including when it says it
