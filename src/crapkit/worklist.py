"""Ranked worklist, dormant-risk list, session claims and batch splitting. Pure.

Active = churned files ranked by scored complexity (CRAP once coverage lanes
exist; min-CCN until then) with a floor so trivial functions never appear.
Dormant = the same scoring over files with zero churn in the window, kept
separate so sleeping hazards are recorded without clogging the queue.

`Admission` is the one rule behind both this list and next-item's queue. It
answers a single question — is this row a candidate? — and the ceiling half of
the answer outranks the floor: debt over its ceiling is admissible at any ccn.

Shared admission, different views. This list ranks every candidate by risk,
finished rows and no-lane rows included, so it never empties and never hides a
hazard. next-item ranks by CRAP descending, drops what no lane measures, and
reports empty once nothing it ranks has work left. Each entry carries the run's
`flag` and `remedy` so a row says which view it belongs to, and its `crap` and
`cov`, because the ranking view of a CRAP scorer has to show the score.
