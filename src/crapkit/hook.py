"""Pre-commit gate: min-CCN over the target on functions touched by the staged diff.

Checks STAGED blobs, never the working tree, so unstaged noise cannot block a
clean commit and a dirty checkout cannot sneak past one.

The hook is a hot path measured in what a developer waits for at every `git
commit`, so it holds three rules the batch commands do not:

- One `git cat-file --batch` for all staged blobs, and each blob fetched once.
  Per-file `git show` spawns cost ~22ms each and made the floor scale with the
  commit size.
- No repo-wide analysis cache. Loading and rewriting it cost a flat 0.45s on an
  18 MB cache while the analysis it could save is milliseconds: a commit's worth
  of blobs is cheaper to analyze outright than to look up.
- A commit's worth of files is analyzed in this process, from the blobs already
  in memory: no worker pool below the crossover, and no temp tree to read back.
