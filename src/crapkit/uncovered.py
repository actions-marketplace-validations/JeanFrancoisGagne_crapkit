"""Dark lines per function: which lines inside a span no lane ever ran.

The line-level truth is the one the diff-coverage check already reads — every
lane's missing-line set, intersected, so a line stays dark only when NO lane
ran it. What this module adds is a verdict on whether the artifacts on disk
still describe the working tree. Line numbers from an artifact built before the
last edit point at code that has moved, which is worse than no numbers at all:
then the lines are [] and a note names the lane to rerun.

The intersection is also the seam a lane can fill in from the walk it was
already doing, so the fold lives here next to the rule it obeys rather than in
the reader that produces the numbers.
