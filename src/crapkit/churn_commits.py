"""The churn window's commits, kept on disk so a moved HEAD folds in only the new ones.

`churn_cache` keys its per-file map on HEAD, so the first churn read after any
commit misses it, and the miss parsed the whole window again: on a large
consumer repo, 3.3 s to re-read a 635,761-line log of which a handful of lines
were new. This file keeps what the map is computed from, `churn.WindowCommits`:
each commit's author, author date and commit date, and each path's commits. A
miss at a HEAD that grew from the stored one walks `git log stored..HEAD`,
expires what aged out, and computes the map from the table.

Read only on a map miss. Expiry reads the commit date at git's own --since
cutoff while the weights read the author date. A carried table can list a
merged branch's commits in another order than git's log does, and the weights
are exact sums for that reason, so a carried table answers what a full parse of
the same commits would, byte for byte. A HEAD the table is not
behind (a rewind, a rebase, a force-push), another window, another path format,
or a cutoff earlier than the stored one is a full rebuild. git's month
arithmetic is what moves the cutoff back: 6 months before Aug 31 is Mar 3, and
before Sep 1 it is Mar 1. A shallow clone keeps no table: deepening one adds
history under an unmoved HEAD, and only a walk sees it. (A full clone later cut
shallow keeps the commits its table already holds, as the stored log does.)

The file is one key line, then the table as JSON. The key line carries the
body's size and CRC: a torn or corrupted table reads as cold, never as a
crash, and a key that does not answer is refused before the body is parsed.
