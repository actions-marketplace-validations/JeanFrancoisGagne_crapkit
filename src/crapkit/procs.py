"""Shell commands whose completion includes cleanup of their descendants.

An owner registers each command before it runs any code. Windows starts the
command suspended and resumes it once its Job holds it; POSIX holds a launcher
at a start gate that execs the command after registration. Windows Jobs and
POSIX process groups retain ownership after the shell exits.
Completion, timeout and caller death stop the owned group before its resources
are released. POSIX commands must keep their inherited group; an explicit
setsid daemon is outside that ownership. Untimed commands have no deadline.
