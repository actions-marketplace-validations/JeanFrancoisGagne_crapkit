"""Lane runner shell: execute a configured coverage command, parse its artifact.

A lane command's exit code is recorded, not enforced: a suite with known
failures still writes a valid coverage artifact, and demanding green here
would make coverage unmeasurable on a brownfield repo. The artifact existing
and parsing is the contract.

Output STREAMS to .crapkit/lane-<name>.log while the command runs, so a long

    is worse than the exit 5 a missing artifact earns because it looks like an
    answer. Two worktrees of one branch reach it quietly: a venv whose editable
    install points at the other checkout makes coverage.py measure that tree.

    Three verdicts, because zero overlap has three readings and the paths tell
    them apart, against the root. Measured files OUTSIDE the root can only be
    another tree, and that fails the lane. Absolute paths that resolve UNDER it
    are this tree with the runner spelling every path absolutely: the join is
    root-relative, so it matches nothing either, and that fails the lane too —
    with the runner's own knob named, because the venv advice above is not the
    cause and path_prefix only prepends. In-tree relative paths that simply miss
    the scopes are the greenfield shape as well — a suite that imports none of
    the scoped source yet, which SHOULD score untested — so that one warns and
    scores on.

    A mixed artifact is another tree. A path from somewhere else can only have
    come from somewhere else, and the absolute in-tree ones are what the same
