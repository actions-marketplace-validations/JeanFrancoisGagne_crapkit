"""Protocol 1: one Claude Code PostToolUse payload on stdin, a ccn advisory out.

Exit 2 with three lines of stderr is the only thing this ever says, and it says
it about exactly one thing: a function the edit changed, in a scope crapkit
measures, over its ceiling, carrying no ratchet mark. Everything else is exit 0
and silence: the malformed payload, the unmeasured repo, the half-typed source
and the internal exception included.

An Edit, Write or MultiEdit event names its file in `tool_input.file_path` and
is judged as that one file. A Bash event carries `tool_input.command` instead —
a heredoc or `python - <<'PY'` writes source no file_path ever names — so it
falls back to the working tree: the changed *.py files fresh enough for this
command to have plausibly written, each through the same per-file ladder.

That silence is the design, not laziness. On PostToolUse a nonzero exit that is
not 2 is invisible and a 2 is text the model has to read, so a hook that fires
where crapkit measures nothing is either useless or unbearable; 47.5% of the
edits this was measured against land in repos with no crapkit.toml. It is also
why this rung diverges from the house exit-3 policy: a hook that exited 3 in
every unmeasured repo could not be installed machine-wide at all.

The hook never blocks and never says it did. PostToolUse runs after the write.
`hook-precommit` stays the only enforcement point.

Two constraints shape the code rather than the contract:

- Module scope is stdlib only, and stays that way. `_Handler` imports this
  module before the body runs, so anything imported here is paid by every edit
  on the machine, including the ones in repos crapkit never measures.
- The snapshot store is never opened. The advisory needs source, configuration
  and committed ratchet marks; opening a store would add schema inspection and
  database I/O to every edit. Old stores can still need a migration. The hook
  stays independent of that lifecycle and writes nothing.
