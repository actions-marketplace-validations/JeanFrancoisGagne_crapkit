"""The verdict. Pure: fresh scored rows + changed ranges + ratchet + failure sets in, Verdict out.

Three independent checks, all must hold:
- Gate: every function a change touched sits at CRAP <= target (coverage cannot
  save cc > target; that is the target's design), unless a ratchet mark carries
  it at or under the recorded value: that is the debt the repo signed for, and
  `rescore --gate` and the pre-commit hook already read it so (#29).
- Ratchet: no function above target scores worse than its recorded high-water
  mark, touched or not (coverage rot regresses functions nobody edited).
- Failures: the fresh failure set adds nothing over the baseline's (the suite
  is never assumed green; 98 pre-existing failures measured on day one).
