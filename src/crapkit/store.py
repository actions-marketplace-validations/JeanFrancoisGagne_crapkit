"""Append-only SQLite snapshot store.

Run metadata (commit, tool versions, lane provenance) lives on the run row;
scored rows are pure data keyed by run. Nothing here is ever updated in
place — a rebuild is a new run. Coverage columns are NULL on inventory-only
runs and populated on scored runs.

A function's identity — scope, path, long_name — lives once, in `identities`,
and every run's rows point at it by id. Storing the three strings on the row
rewrote a hundred thousand identities on every run; the flagship consumer's
store reached 246 MB that way. The reads join them back, so nothing above this
module can tell: read_rows and read_scored return the same values in the same
order, and identity ids never reach a sort key.

`runs prune` is the one exception to append-only, and it deletes whole runs
rather than editing any row: see prune_keep_set for what it may never take.
