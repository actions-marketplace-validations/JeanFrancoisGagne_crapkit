"""The one door to churn data, with git's tree walk cached behind it.

`git log --name-only` over a year of a large repo costs 6.5s, 5.8s of which is
git diffing every commit's tree, and worklist, next-item and coupling each paid
it in full on every invocation, at an unmoved HEAD. Every one of them reaches
git through this module, so `.crapkit/churn-cache-v2.json` has one writer.

The key is (HEAD sha, window months, UTC date, path format). The sha pins the
history; the window pins the command; the date is there because `--since=N
months ago` is evaluated against the wall clock, so yesterday's cache describes
a window one day wider than today's; the format marker retires maps whose
paths predate exact path decoding. Anything else is a miss, and a miss
rebuilds.

A miss is not a full parse when it can be avoided: the map is computed from
the window's commits, which `churn_commits` keeps, so a HEAD that grew from
the stored table walks only the new commits (see that module).

A cache is disposable: unreadable, corrupt or unkeyable content reads as cold,
never as a crash. Uncommitted work is invisible to churn either way. The one
thing a sha does not pin is depth — deepening a shallow clone adds history
under an unmoved HEAD — and that resolves itself at the next date rollover,
because a shallow clone keeps no commit table to carry.
