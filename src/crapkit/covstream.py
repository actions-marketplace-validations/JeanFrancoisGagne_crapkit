"""Coverage artifacts read off the file instead of out of a string.

Reading an entire artifact with `read_bytes()` plus its UTF-8 decode puts two
copies of a 150 MB artifact on the heap before a function is attributed. This
module owns the JSON walk and refills a window from a handle. The format
modules project each decoded file into coverage, missing lines or contexts.

Peak becomes O(chunk + largest member) rather than O(artifact): 322.6 -> 52.1 MB
on a 150 MB istanbul artifact, for byte-identical output and the same sha256.

Both shapes are split the same way. An istanbul artifact IS the {path: coverage}
object, so its members are files. A coverage.py report wraps them one level down
in "files", so the walk descends into that member and hands the rest back whole.
