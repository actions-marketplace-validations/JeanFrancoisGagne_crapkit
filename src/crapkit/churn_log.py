"""The churn window's raw log, kept on disk deflated, and refreshed instead of rewalked.

`churn_cache` stores the DERIVED per-file map. Coupling needs the structure that
map threw away — which files shared a commit — so `brief` and `worklist
--batches` re-walked twelve months of history on every invocation: 6.9 s of git
diffing every commit's tree, at an unmoved HEAD, for a stream they read once.
Off disk the same 628k lines take 0.22 s.

This is that stream, written down. Deflated, because the log is 23 MB of highly
repetitive path text that compresses to 4.7 MB, and reading 4.7 MB is what makes
the copy worth having. The whole compressed file is read before the first line
goes out (its CRC is the only way to know a log is not half-written); the 23 MB
of text it holds never is.

Two things are stored beyond the author and author date a churn header needs.
The commit date (%ct) rides along on every header line, so an aged-out commit
can be expired without asking git, and the lines are served that way: coupling
only asks which lines open a commit and the churn parser reads either header
shape, so no reader pays a pass to strip it. And the key records the HEAD the
log was built from, so a HEAD that grew from it costs `git log cached..HEAD`
instead of the window — 0.77 s instead of 6.9 s at a day-old HEAD, for the
same 628k lines. Commit date is not author date: `--since` filters on the
committer's clock while the recency weight uses the author's, and a rebased
commit has two different ones. The key also records the cutoff the log was cut
at, because that cutoff can move back: git's month arithmetic puts 6 months
before Aug 31 on Mar 3 and before Sep 1 on Mar 1, and a log cut at the later
cutoff cannot be re-dated to the earlier one.

A cache is disposable. An unreadable, torn or unkeyable log reads as cold, never
as a crash, and a HEAD the cached log is not an ancestor of (a rewind, a rebase,
a force-push) rebuilds rather than prepends.
