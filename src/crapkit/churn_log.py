"""The churn window's raw log, kept on disk deflated, and refreshed instead of rewalked.

`churn_cache` stores the DERIVED per-file map. Coupling needs the structure that
map threw away — which files shared a commit — so `brief` and `worklist
--batches` re-walked twelve months of history on every invocation: 6.9 s of git
diffing every commit's tree, at an unmoved HEAD, for a stream they read once.
Off disk the same 628k lines take 0.22 s.

This is that stream, written down. Deflated, because the log is 23 MB of highly
repetitive path text that compresses to 4.7 MB, and reading 4.7 MB is what makes
the copy worth having. The whole compressed file is read before the first line
goes out (its CRC is the only way to know a log is not half-written); the 23 MB
of text it holds never is.

Two things are stored that the served lines do not carry. The commit date (%ct)
rides along on every header line, so an aged-out commit can be expired without
asking git; and the key records the HEAD the log was built from, so a HEAD that
grew from it costs `git log cached..HEAD` instead of the window — 0.77 s instead
of 6.9 s at a day-old HEAD, for the same 628k lines. Commit date is not author
date: `--since` filters on the committer's clock while the recency weight uses
the author's, and a rebased commit has two different ones.

A cache is disposable. An unreadable, torn or unkeyable log reads as cold, never
as a crash, and a HEAD the cached log is not an ancestor of (a rewind, a rebase,
a force-push) rebuilds rather than prepends.
