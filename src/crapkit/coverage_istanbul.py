"""Attribute one decoded Istanbul file's branches and statements to functions.

Branch hits map into function spans by line containment. A function with no
branches inside its span falls back to STATEMENT coverage in that span, and
only with no statements either to invocation (hit or not) — a straight-line
function half-executed must not read as fully covered. Written for the
AST-remapped output of @vitest/coverage-v8 >= 3.2, which is istanbul-schema-identical.

covstream owns artifact decoding. This module receives one decoded file and
keeps attribution independent of file I/O and JSON framing.
