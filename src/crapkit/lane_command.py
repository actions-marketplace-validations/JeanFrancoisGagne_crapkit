"""How a configured lane starts, and how its command reads.

A lane command runs under the shell, from `root / cwd`, with its `[lane.env]`
pairs merged over the process environment. lanes.py starts the lane and its
flake retest from `launch_spec`, and doctor resolves words and starts its
probes from the same spec: a word looked up from another directory, or on
another PATH, answers for a child the lane never starts.

The command line itself is read by `config.shell_words` and
`config.shell_segments`, the way the shell that runs it reads it. What this
module adds is the step that runs pytest and the python heading it: lanes.py
names that python in the hint after a lane fails for want of pytest-cov, and
doctor asks it whether pytest-cov imports, so the two cannot name different
words.
