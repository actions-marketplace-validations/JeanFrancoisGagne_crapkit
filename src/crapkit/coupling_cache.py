"""The one door to ranked co-change pairs, with the pairing walk cached behind it.

Three commands rank the same pairs out of the same window: brief's coupling
section, `worklist --batches`, and `coupling` itself. Each one re-cut 12 months
of log into per-commit file sets and re-counted every combination on every
invocation, at an unmoved HEAD. On a 72k-commit consumer that is 0.95 s and
170 MB per run, all of it spent reproducing the list the last run already had.
The deflated churn log removed git's walk; it did not remove this one, because
the pairing reads that log's per-commit structure line by line either way.

The key is the churn map's key (HEAD sha, window months, UTC date, path format)
plus a digest of the tracked set. The tracked set is there because ranking
drops any pair naming a file `git ls-files` no longer lists, and ls-files reads
the INDEX, which moves without HEAD: `git rm --cached src/util.py` leaves the
sha alone and must still retire every pair naming util.py. The digest costs
6 ms over that consumer's 31,684 tracked paths, and every reader already holds
the list, so keying on it buys no spawn.

What is stored is the ranking at the DEFAULT thresholds, ordered, with no cut.
`--top` truncates that total order, so it reads from here. `--min-support` or
`--min-confidence` off the defaults ask a wider question than the file answers,
so those recompute: serving them a filtered subset would silently drop the
pairs the wider thresholds exist to surface.

A cache is disposable: unreadable, corrupt or unkeyable content reads as cold,
never as a crash. A cold run pays the write on top of the walk it was already
paying: 2 ms for that consumer's 2,368 pairs, 234 kB on disk.
