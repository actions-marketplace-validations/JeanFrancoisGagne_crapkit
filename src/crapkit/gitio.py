# relative to the repo TOP, so under a root one directory down (a monorepo
# member, a project nested in a worktree) `app/core/x.py` met rows saying
# `core/x.py` and every join missed — the commit gate passed a ccn 12 function,
# lane reuse read a changed scope as unchanged. One config flag on the process
# covers every diff command here, so a reader added later is right by default.
#
# core.quotePath answers the same question about spelling. On by default, it
# prints a path holding any byte over 0x7f as C-quoted octal text
# (`"src/b\303\252ta.py"`), which no `ls-files -z` row equals, so a dirty
# non-ASCII file fell out of every set built by intersecting the two: lane reuse
# republished a stale score and its scope read as unchanged. Off, status_names,
# diff_names_since, unstaged_paths, churn_log_lines and the `diff -U0` headers
# all spell the path the way ls-files does. git still quotes a path holding a
# double-quote or a control character whatever this says, which is why

    30.6 s of `worktree add` on a 31,459-file tree against 0.46 s here.

    `commit` is a sha the CALLER read from the repository it cares about, never
    the literal HEAD: HEAD inside a linked worktree is that worktree's own
    detached head, which is the commit it was created at. A pool kept across a
    commit would restore the old content under a run that believes it is
    mutating the new one. Naming the sha also means a reused tree needs no
    stale-state check: whatever it held, it holds `commit` afterwards.

    `checkout --force <sha>` rather than the pathspec form `-- .`, because a
    file the new commit DELETED stays on disk and in the index under a pathspec
    checkout, and the tree's own head keeps pointing at the old commit. Both
    forms cost the same (0.44 s against 0.61 s for four 31,459-file trees,
    best of 5 with 4,000 untracked artifact files planted first).

    Then clean: checkout restores tracked files and leaves every artifact the
    last suite wrote. -x because an ignored one (a stale coverage file, a
    node_modules) is what the next suite reads, -d for directories, -ff to
    descend into a checkout something left nested inside.

    The guard is not a courtesy. Both commands find their repository by walking
    UP from the cwd, and a caller keeping worktrees inside the repo (the mutate
    pool lives at `.crapkit/mutate-pool/`) hands this a directory whose `.git`
    pointer a killed run may have taken with it. Without the guard, `checkout
    --force` and `clean -xdff` would find the MAIN repository and run there:
    every uncommitted line and every untracked file gone, from a function whose
    job is to tidy a scratch tree.
