"""A Python reader that reads a def's signature to its body colon. Upstream defect: crapkit #72.

lizard 1.24.0's PythonReader ends a def inside its own signature in two shapes,
and the def then reads as two lines at ccn 1 whatever its body holds, so it
passes the complexity ceiling, the commit hook, `rescore --gate` and `verify`:

    def f(value: int) -> tuple[        def make(cls_name, *, bases=(),
        int, int                                slots=False):
    ]:                                     if slots: ...
        if value > 0: ...

The left one is a return annotation opened on the def line. The right one is a
line break after a parameter default that holds brackets, which is what black
and ruff write for a long signature. Measured before the fix: 39 such defs in
the 3,742 stdlib and site-packages files of crapkit's own Python 3.11
environment, and 20 in the 3,130 files of a large consumer repo.

Three mechanics combine, all in lizard_languages/python.py:

  1. `PythonStates._dec` takes the first `)` token for the end of the parameter
     list, so the `)` of a default like `()` ends it early.
  2. `PythonStates._state_colon` follows `:` into the body and sends anything
     else, `->` included, to `_state_global`: the reader never follows a return
     annotation to its colon.
  3. `PythonReader.preprocess` sets nesting from each line's indent once the
     def's long name ends with `)`. A signature line indented deeper than the
     body pushes the def's nesting level there, the body's first line pops it,
     and the pop ends the def before its body.

The fix, and what it keeps
--------------------------
`PythonSignatureStates` counts bracket depth from the def's `(` and leaves the
signature only at a `:` at depth 0, after the parameter list and after any
return annotation. `PythonSignatureReader.preprocess` sets no nesting while the
states are inside a signature, so the body's first line is the one that pushes
the def. A body on the colon line (`) -> None: ...`) is the one exception,
kept as lizard reads it: see `_SignatureIndents`.

From the def's `(` on, every token still reaches the long name and the
parameter list exactly as lizard routes it. lizard stops both at the
signature's first `)` whatever its depth, and a def of that shape that lizard
already read whole carries that spelling as its ratchet key, so this reader
keeps it: `make( cls_name , * , bases = ( )` above. The states also end where
lizard ends for the same signature written on one line: `_state_first_line`
after `):`, `_state_global` after a return annotation or after a signature
lizard had closed early.

What moves, only around a def lizard cut off: its end line, ccn, nloc, token
count and cognitive score now cover its body, while its long name stays; an
enclosing def gives back the conditions lizard had charged to it from the
nested body; a def nested inside the cut-off def gains its parent's name as a
prefix, as it has under a parent read whole.

Type parameter lists (PEP 695)
------------------------------
lizard names a def after the last token before its `(`, and a generic def
keeps its type parameter list there: `def f[T](a: int):` reads as
`]( a : int )`, and `def f[T: (int, str)](a):` as `:( int , str )`. That name
is no part of the def's own. It is the ratchet key; it collides with every
other generic def in the file that takes the same parameters; the cognitive
pass reads each `]` in the body as a call to the def; and a type parameter
list over several lines starts the def on the list's last line.

`_type_parameters` counts the list to its `]` with the same `depth` the
parameter list uses and hands none of its tokens to lizard's naming. The def
is named by its name token and its parameters read as lizard spells them:
`f( a : int )`. The reader changes this spelling, and the nested names below,
because neither is a prefix of the def's own name the way
`make( cls_name , * , bases = ( )` is.

Nested def names
----------------
lizard qualifies a new def with the full name of every def on its nesting
stack (`NestingStack.with_namespace`), and each of those names already carries
its own parents. Two deep that reads `a.b`; three deep it read `a.a.b.c`, and
four deep `a.a.b.a.a.b.c.d`. `_name_under_parent` qualifies the def by its
innermost enclosing def alone: `a.b.c`. A class adds nothing to the name, as
under lizard.

What this leaves as lizard reads it: a def whose body sits on its colon line
(`def g(self): pass`) and whose signature pushed no level is never listed and
stays pending on the nesting stack, so the next def pushed deeper carries its
name: `test_autospec.g.a( self )` for a method `a` of a class declared after
`g`.

The class name
--------------
lizardcognitive picks its Python rules by `type(reader).__name__` starting with
"python". A name like `CorrectedPythonReader` would score every Python file
with the brace rules.

Registration
------------
The same mechanism as crapkit.lizardrust, whose docstring explains it:
`register()` rebinds `lizard_languages.PythonReader`, which
`lizard_languages.languages()` reads on every call, verifies the rebind through
`lizard.get_reader_for`, and raises if it did not take. analyze.py calls it at
module scope beside the other readers' registrations, so pool workers register
too.

Retirement
----------
Three tests in tests/unit/test_lizardpython.py pin the stock reader's wrong
answers: test_stock_reader_still_cuts_the_issue_def_off for #72,
test_stock_reader_still_names_a_generic_def_after_a_bracket for PEP 695, and
test_stock_reader_still_repeats_the_outer_names_three_deep for nested names.
Each fails on the lizard release that fixes its part. Delete this module, with
the `register()` call, once all three fail; while one still passes, the
override for that part stays.
