"""A Python reader that reads a def's signature to its body colon. Upstream defect: crapkit #72.

lizard 1.24.0's PythonReader ends a def inside its own signature in two shapes,
and the def then reads as two lines at ccn 1 whatever its body holds, so it
passes the complexity ceiling, the commit hook, `rescore --gate` and `verify`:

    def f(value: int) -> tuple[        def make(cls_name, *, bases=(),
        int, int                                slots=False):
    ]:                                     if slots: ...
        if value > 0: ...

The left one is a return annotation opened on the def line. The right one is a
line break after a parameter default that holds brackets, which is what black
and ruff write for a long signature. Measured before the fix: 39 such defs in
the 3,742 stdlib and site-packages files of crapkit's own Python 3.11
environment, and 20 in 3,130 openclaw files.

Three mechanics combine, all in lizard_languages/python.py:

  1. `PythonStates._dec` takes the first `)` token for the end of the parameter
     list, so the `)` of a default like `()` ends it early.
  2. `PythonStates._state_colon` follows `:` into the body and sends anything
     else, `->` included, to `_state_global`: the reader never follows a return
     annotation to its colon.
  3. `PythonReader.preprocess` sets nesting from each line's indent once the
     def's long name ends with `)`. A signature line indented deeper than the
     body pushes the def's nesting level there, the body's first line pops it,
     and the pop ends the def before its body.

The fix, and what it keeps
--------------------------
`PythonSignatureStates` counts bracket depth from the def's `(` and leaves the
signature only at a `:` at depth 0, after the parameter list and after any
return annotation. `PythonSignatureReader.preprocess` sets no nesting while the
states are inside a signature, so the body's first line is the one that pushes
the def. A body on the colon line (`) -> None: ...`) is the one exception,
kept as lizard reads it: see `_SignatureIndents`.

Every token still reaches the long name and the parameter list exactly as
lizard routes it. lizard stops both at the signature's first `)` whatever its
depth, and a def of that shape that lizard already read whole carries that
spelling as its ratchet key, so this reader keeps it: `make( cls_name , * ,
bases = ( )` above. The states also end where lizard ends for the same
signature written on one line: `_state_first_line` after `):`, `_state_global`
after a return annotation or after a signature lizard had closed early.

What moves, only around a def lizard cut off: its end line, ccn, nloc, token
count and cognitive score now cover its body, while its long name stays; an
enclosing def gives back the conditions lizard had charged to it from the
nested body; a def nested inside the cut-off def gains its parent's name as a
prefix, as it has under a parent read whole.

The class name
--------------
lizardcognitive picks its Python rules by `type(reader).__name__` starting with
"python". A name like `CorrectedPythonReader` would score every Python file
with the brace rules.

Registration
------------
The same mechanism as crapkit.lizardrust, whose docstring explains it:
`register()` rebinds `lizard_languages.PythonReader`, which
`lizard_languages.languages()` reads on every call, verifies the rebind through
`lizard.get_reader_for`, and raises if it did not take. analyze.py calls it at
module scope beside the other readers' registrations, so pool workers register
too.

Retirement
----------
tests/unit/test_lizardpython.py::test_stock_reader_still_cuts_the_issue_def_off
pins the stock reader's wrong answer. It fails on the lizard release that reads
these signatures. Delete this module then, with the `register()` call.
