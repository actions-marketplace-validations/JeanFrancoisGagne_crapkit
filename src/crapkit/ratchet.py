"""The committed ratchet: per-function high-water CRAP marks for functions above target.

Pure text <-> entries. Marks only ever tighten: an improvement lowers or drops
an entry on update; a regression NEVER raises one (it surfaces as a verdict
failure instead); brand-new debt enters only through the audited override.

Identity is (path, key name): spans drift with every edit, names survive. A key
name is the function's long_name, plus a `#N` ordinal when the file gives that
name to more than one function — see `keys`. The first twin keeps the bare name,
so a marks file written before the ordinal reads unchanged.

The file opens with a metric stamp comment naming the analysis version and the
lizard that produced the numbers. Marks measured under different rules are not
comparable, and without the stamp that reads as a clean run.
