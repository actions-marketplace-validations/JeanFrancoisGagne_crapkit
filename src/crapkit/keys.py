"""The ratchet key: which function a mark, a gate and a verdict are about. Pure.

A key is `(path, key name)`. The key name is the function's long_name when the
file gives that name to one function, and `long_name#N` for the Nth function
sharing it, counted in start order.

Before the ordinal, a file's twins shared one key. Only one of them could be
marked and only one could be gated, so the others grew past every ceiling with
no gate firing and no mark recording the debt. Python makes that ordinary: a
method's long_name carries no class, so several dataclasses in one module each
defining `__post_init__` collide by construction. C makes it ordinary too, since
both arms of an `#ifdef` fork are textually present.

Two properties earn the ordinal over the start line the key could have used:

- It survives line drift. An edit above a function moves every span below it and
  would re-key marks that nothing touched.
- It renumbers honestly. Rename one twin and the others shift by one, which is
  what happened: they really are different functions now.

The first twin keeps the BARE name. That is what makes the change free to adopt:
every mark recorded under the old two-field key already reads as twin #1, so no
committed `crapkit-ratchet.tsv` needs rewriting.

Anonymous functions take the same canonical key rule within each raw
signature. Their printed `(anonymous)#N` handles count all anonymous spans
in the file, starting at #1. Claims save the canonical key separately because
the printed ordinal does not identify an ordinal within one signature.

The naming rules live here too, beside the keys they reach: the bare name, the
handles, and `select`, the one resolver every command that takes a NAME runs.
`brief` resolved in the queue and `explain` in the store, and a bare twin name
picked the worst twin in one and the first in the other.
