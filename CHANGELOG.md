# Changelog

## 0.8.0 — 2026-09-23

The Python reader moves to analysis version 11, so every repo re-seeds its marks once.
`ratchet seed` and `ratchet prune` take `--baseline ID`, the way out when a failed
verify pins them to a run they cannot read (#75). Reads on a large store get faster, and
`--reuse-unchanged` can reuse a lane across commits once the lane lists its inputs. The
twelve MCP tools and JSON schema version 1 remain compatible with 0.7.x.

### Upgrading from 0.7.x

- Analysis version 11 renames some Python functions and moves some scores (next
  section). In each repo run `crapkit coverage`, then `crapkit ratchet prune`, then
  `crapkit ratchet seed`. Prune drops the marks left under the old names, and on a marks
  file with no `# crapkit-keys=1` line it has to go first. Seed stamps the marks with
  the metric of the run it reads, so a seed before the fresh coverage run keeps the old
  stamp and verify keeps refusing. When a failed verify pins the baseline, pass the new
  run to both, `crapkit ratchet prune --baseline N` and then `crapkit ratchet seed
  --baseline N`; their lines and verify's refusal name it. The first `inventory` or
  `coverage` analyzes every file again. See the [upgrade
  guide](https://github.com/JeanFrancoisGagne/crapkit/blob/v0.8.0/docs/upgrading.md#analysis-version-11).
- `test_retention_days` and `test_retention_count` are deprecated and ignored. A config
  that sets them still loads, including values that used to be refused, and `doctor`
  prints one WARN per key naming the development runner's flag that replaced it,
  `--retention-days` or `--retention-count`. Delete them. `doctor --json` keeps both
  fields under `resources`, always 0, and neither the editor schema nor an unknown-key
  message lists them.
- A lane can now list the paths its command reads as `inputs`. The reuse proof covers
  that field, and the stamp stores it as `proof`, so the first `--reuse-unchanged` after
  upgrading reruns every lane once. Declare `inputs` on each lane to get reuse across
  commits.
- The Claude Code plugin needs the crapkit CLI of its own release. Both manifests said
  0.4.0 or newer, but the recover skill runs `ratchet seed --baseline N`, which a 0.7.x
  CLI rejects, and `crapkit doctor --plugin-root` reports any version gap. Upgrade the
  CLI and the plugin together.
- Library API: `dump_ratchet` takes no default stamp, `RatchetFile` renders every marks
  write through `kept`, `measured` or `reseeded`, and `record_override` requires
  `metric=`. The coverage `parse_*` readers moved from `covstream` to one adapter module
  per format, `coverage_istanbul` and `coverage_py`, and the unused
  `parse_istanbul_file` and `parse_coveragepy_file` are gone.

### A Python def is read under its own name, whatever its shape (analysis version 11)

- A def with a PEP 695 type parameter list, such as `def f[T](a: int):`, was named after
  the bracket or colon before its `(`: `]( a : int )`, or `:( int , str )` for a
  constrained bound. It is now named `f( a : int )`. The old name collided across every
  generic def in a file that took the same parameters, made each `]` in the body count
  as recursion in `cognitive`, and started a def whose type parameter list spans several
  lines on that list's last line. A generic def with no annotated parameter (`def
  f[T](a):`) no longer gets its whole file refused, and one with a constrained bound and
  a line break after a default reads its whole body instead of two lines at ccn 1.
- A def nested three or more deep names each enclosing def once: `a.b.c( x )`, where it
  read `a.a.b.c( x )`. A decorator factory's inner function read
  `require_admin.require_admin.decorator.with_admin( self )` and now reads
  `require_admin.decorator.with_admin( self )`.
- A def whose body sits on its colon line (`def f(x): return x`, `def g(): ...`, a stub
  after an exploded signature) is listed as the same def written over two lines is, one
  line shorter. It was missing from every report, gate and mark, the lines after it
  counted toward it, an enclosing def lost its own conditions, and a later def could
  carry its name. One-line `@overload` stubs take twin keys as two-line stubs do. A
  one-line body that leaves a bracket count open, such as the fill character in
  `f"{x:(>10}"`, no longer hides the defs after it.
- Cognitive complexity and nesting count a def's body from the colon that ends its
  signature. A body on the colon line read cognitive 0 and nesting 0 whatever it held,
  and a signature's continuation lines counted as body: a default naming the function
  read as recursion, and a parameter named `do` as a loop.
- A Python file that ends inside a def's signature is refused and names that def, under
  crapkit's reader and lizard's stock reader alike. Before, only a nested def was
  refused this way, and a top-level def or a method was left out of a file that scored.
  The advisory hook still reads such a half-typed file quietly.
- Measured over 5,746 stdlib, site-packages and application files: 1,632 rows are added
  and 557 existing rows change name, end line or ccn; the nested-name fix alone renames
  442 of 121,648 rows, and 19 of 123,320 rows move `cognitive`, 2 of them `nesting`.
  Over 187 PEP 695 files, 422 of 4,730 rows change name and no `ccn` moves. Some added
  rows are enclosing defs that were never listed, and they can be over a ceiling.
  crapkit's own tree reads the same apart from two renamed test helpers.
- The first run after the upgrade analyzes every file again, so the twin-key note, one
  stderr line per file that gives one name to several functions, came out for every
  such file: 1,021 lines on a large consumer repo, over the lane progress lines. One
  run now names five files at most, in path order, and ends with `crapkit: ... and N
  more file(s) define a name more than once`.

### A template literal nested in another's `${...}` no longer hides the functions after it

- lizard reads a JavaScript, JSX, TypeScript or TSX template literal as everything up to
  the next backtick, so the opening backtick of a template nested in `${...}` closed the
  outer one. An escaped backtick in the text did the same, and so did a brace inside a
  string, comment, regex literal or nested template's text within `${...}`, which threw
  off lizard's count of where the expression ends. The reader then stayed inside a
  template until the next backtick in the file: every function after it was folded into
  the function around it or dropped, so reports, marks and `rescore --gate` never saw
  it. On a large consumer repo a ccn-10 function appended after one passed the gate with
  0 functions judged. 0.7.x reads these files the same way.
- crapkit now blanks those characters with spaces before lizard reads the file, so every
  line and column stays put and each template reads as a flat one does. A file with no
  such template reaches lizard unchanged. A function written inside `${...}` is still
  not listed, as in a flat template.
- Measured over a large consumer repo's 12,547 scored TypeScript files: 696 hold such a
  template and 492 of them read differently. 5,955 rows are added, 1,061 go and 513 keep
  their name but change span or ccn. 251 of the rows that go were functions written
  inside one of those templates. A top-level function appended to a file was
  missing from 703 files and is now missing from 336; the rest come from other shapes
  lizard misreads, such as a template inside a `case` label's block, and 8 files showed
  one only because a nested template flipped the reader back out of one of them.

### A one-line Python def is told to split its lines

- A Python def written on one line, in a scope a lane measures, scores as uncovered with
  remedy `split-lines` in the coverage run, `rescore`, `rescore --gate`, `check_gate`,
  `brief` and `next-item` alike. Its only line is the `def` statement, which runs at
  import, so coverage.py could not show whether a test called it: an uncalled
  `def one(x): return x` read 1 of 2 branches covered, and an uncalled one-liner that is
  its module's only line read cov 1.0. Move the body to the line after the `def` and
  measure again.
- So does a def whose body starts on the last line of a signature that spans several
  lines, or goes on from the colon's line inside brackets or after a backslash:
  coverage.py reads that body as the `def` statement too. Called, the first shape read
  measured cov 0.0; uncalled, `def f(x): return [` with `x]` on the next line read 0.5.
  The store keeps the reader's mark for such a def in a new `inline_body` column, which
  the TSV exports and `brief --json` leave out.
- A one-line TypeScript function keeps its istanbul number, since istanbul counts calls
  per function, and the shared-span note still names only spans two functions declare.

### `ratchet seed` and `prune` take `--baseline ID`, the way past a failed verify (#75)

- `crapkit ratchet seed --baseline ID` and `ratchet prune --baseline ID` read a named
  run. They admit it by the rule `verify --baseline ID` uses and refuse a failed verify,
  a hook run, a partial run or an inventory run in the same words. A store whose marks
  carried an older stamp, with a failed verify in front of a run stored before same-line
  positions, left no command that worked: seed read the pinned run, refused its twins,
  and a fresh coverage run changed nothing. `ratchet merge`, `move` and `report` refuse
  the flag.
- When a failed verify makes seed or prune fall back to an older run, their line names
  the newer run it passed over and the flag that reads it: ``skipped failed verify run 2
  and the newer run 3 (pass `--baseline 3` to read it)``.
- verify reads its baseline before the metric-stamp check. A named run that cannot serve
  is refused for itself, and the taint warning prints before a stamp refusal. On a store
  a failed verify pins, the stamp refusal ends with the seed that clears it (re-baseline
  from run N with `crapkit ratchet seed --baseline N`), naming the run the taint warning
  names, under a plain `verify`, `--baseline ID` and `--base` alike.
- The seed line for a run an older crapkit measured no longer promises that a fresh
  coverage run and another seed clear the stamp when a failed verify pins seed or
  `--baseline` named the run. It names the newer run to pass to `--baseline`, or asks
  for a coverage run and its id.
- The legacy-identity refusal from seed, prune, explain, brief, next-item and rescore
  names the run it read:
  `ambiguous legacy function identity in src/a.ts: (anonymous) in run 1; ...`. From seed
  and prune behind a failed verify it names that verify, the one verify's taint warning
  names, and the `--baseline` to pass, where it advised refreshing analysis, which a
  fresh coverage run could not satisfy.
- A marks file with no `# crapkit-keys=1` line keeps the old key format while any mark
  names a function the run lacks, and that format cannot key two functions that start on
  one line. A seed that would add a mark for one of them now refuses before writing and
  names `ratchet prune`, with the same `--baseline`, which drops those marks. It used to
  render the file and then refuse the twin groups it was adding as saved marks to
  reconcile: 170 groups on a large consumer repo, none of them in the file.

### Marks keep the metric stamp of the run that measured them

- `ratchet seed` stamps the marks with the metric of the run it read, not the running
  one, and refuses a run that recorded no metric. After an upgrade, run `crapkit
  coverage` before `ratchet seed`: a seed from an older run keeps verify refusing, and
  the seed line says so.
- `ratchet prune` keeps the recorded stamp, and its line names the run's metric when it
  differs from this crapkit's. A marks file prune creates holds no mark and takes the
  running metric, so the next verify accepts it.
- The pre-commit hook's `CRAPKIT_OVERRIDE_REASON` grant no longer restamps the marks
  file: a file recorded under another metric stays stale until `crapkit coverage` and a
  reseed. Under a stamp older than analysis 10, the grant refuses an anonymous
  JavaScript or TypeScript callback and writes no alert, store row or mark. It used to
  write an `(anonymous)` mark that every later reader refused with exit 3.
- verify's stamp refusal, its unstamped-file warning and the merge driver's refusal say
  to run `crapkit coverage`, then re-baseline with `crapkit ratchet seed`. Seed alone,
  right after an upgrade, kept the old stamp.
- `ratchet move` reads OLD and NEW like every other path argument, so `./` prefixes,
  Windows backslashes and paths typed below the root file the mark under its
  repo-relative key.

### brief, explain and next-item agree on which function a name means

- explain, brief and get_function_history answer for a same-line twin when an older run
  recorded the twins without positions. The history leaves out only the runs that cannot
  place the twin, and a `runs prune` that keeps such a run no longer blocks these reads.
  A name reads only its own twins' positions, so a legacy collision elsewhere in the
  file no longer refuses it.
- check_gate, explain and the commit gate prove legacy mark identity for the files they
  read, plus any marked file the working tree no longer has. A legacy twin group in
  another file still on disk no longer refuses them. brief proves it for its packet's
  file alone, so a legacy twin group in another file no longer refuses a brief either.
  `ratchet prune` still refuses to carry a legacy mark through a rename, and explain
  still refuses a legacy mark on a file the newest run dropped.
- explain and get_function_history answer a bare twin name with the worst twin, as brief
  does. They reported the first twin's history and mark whenever the worse twin came
  later in the file.
- explain reads a start line and an `(anonymous)#N` handle off the newest trusted run,
  the run brief reads, so a failed verify taken after it no longer changes which
  function they name. With no trusted run yet it reads the newest run with rows, and a
  file the newest trusted run dropped is read from the newest one that holds it. A start
  line that opens several functions exits 1 with the handles to use, as brief does; it
  exited 5 without them.
- brief and next-item judge `remedy` against the ceiling crapkit.toml holds now, the
  number `target` and the budget already came from. After an uncommitted edit from 6 to
  4, a ccn-5 function read `remedy: ok` beside `est_splits: 2`, and next-item never
  offered it. worklist still prints the verdict the run stored.
- `brief --batch` skips a function another session holds under `next-item --claim`, as
  next-item does, and the envelope carries `skipped_claimed` when a claim hid a row.
- brief's twins apply the similarity threshold to the raw containment, as `duplication`
  does, so a pair just under the threshold appears in neither, and only a function that
  shares a shingle with the target is scored, so a similarity of 0 no longer lists every
  function at 0.
- On a store that holds no run with rows, such as one holding only hook runs,
  `duplication` and `worklist` say `no run with rows in <root>` instead of `no
  snapshot`.

### check_gate and the MCP schemas say what they check

- check_gate's title, its description and the MCP server instructions name the rule it
  applies, `rescore --gate`'s: a ratchet mark pardons a changed function only while its
  crap is at or under the mark. That is stricter than the pre-commit hook, and a breach
  predicts a verify refusal. The `path` argument says it takes an absolute path inside
  the repo, that an outside or missing path is a config error, and that an unchanged or
  unscoped file judges 0.
- `rescore`, `rescore --gate` and `check_gate` gave two functions edited onto one line
  span their old measured coverage and called them ok. They now score both untested at
  cov 0 with remedy `split-lines`, as the next `coverage` run does.
- `list_worklist`'s output schema refused the null `remedy` every row of an
  inventory-only run carries, so an MCP client that validates structured results dropped
  the whole answer.
- The docs quote the MCP argument refusals as the server prints them
  (`get_function_brief needs name (see inputSchema.required)`), and show `brief --json`
  as the payload has it, checked against a live payload.

### Reads on a large store are faster

- The legacy ratchet key check builds its group union once instead of once per mark. On
  a large consumer repo with 39,496 legacy marks, `worklist` fell from 133.9 s to 12.4 s
  and `brief --json` from 150.3 s to 22.0 s (warm medians, byte-identical output).
  `report`, `ratchet seed`, `ratchet prune` and `verify` run the same check.
- Each run's same-line collision groups are scanned once, kept in a per-run
  `run_collisions` table and deleted by `runs prune` with the run. On a 4.17M-row,
  29-run store, explain went from 14.0 to 2.8 s and check_gate from 12.0 to 2.5 s; with
  the key-group hoist, worklist went from 14.7 to 4.7 s and brief from 13.0 to 4.4 s.
- brief reads only the file it is about. Its twins come from a shingle index the store
  keeps for the run: `inventory` and `coverage` build and store it as they record the
  run, and every brief in any process looks its function up. `verify` stores no index,
  since it runs on every commit, so after a verify run, or a run an older crapkit
  recorded, the first brief or `duplication` builds and stores it; on a large consumer
  repo that brief took 9.2 to 16.5 s longer than the brief after it (six cycles on a
  quiet machine). The source and twins fields went from 3.2-4.1 s to 0.001 s per brief,
  and the index takes 37.8 MB of the store. `duplication` at the default `--min-lines`
  reads the stored index and opens no file. A shingle is an 8-byte blake2b digest, so
  one process's index reads the same in another. Storing a run's index drops every
  older run's, and `runs prune` drops it with its run.
- `rescore --gate` and `check_gate` read the marks only when a changed function is over
  its ceiling, as `hook-precommit` did. A clean check_gate on a large consumer repo went
  from 14.2 s to 2.1 s (warm medians, loaded machine). A clean gate no longer reports a
  marks file it cannot parse; the next gate that breaches still does.
- `rescore` of fewer than 16 files that total under 256 KB runs lizard on them in
  process and leaves `.crapkit/cache.json` and `.crapkit/stat-stamps.json` unread and
  unwritten; past either limit it folds its records into the cache. Rescoring an edited
  56 KB file on a large consumer repo went from 1.6 s to 0.43 s. On that path a file
  that gives one name to two functions prints its twin-name note on every run.
- An empty next-item queue parses no lane artifact and asks git nothing about lane
  sources. On crapkit's own empty queue the warm median fell from 4.41 s to 0.94 s,
  output byte-identical.
- `next-item`, `brief`, `explain` and `report` start their lane staleness git reads
  together and narrow them to the lanes' scope paths, so a large untracked tree outside
  every scope no longer costs a full listing. On a large consumer repo, the git time
  outside process creation fell from 2.46 s to 0.11 s per call.
- Coverage artifacts are read through a 4 MB window, so most file members decode in C.
  crapkit's own coverage.py report with contexts parses in 0.26 s instead of 1.03 s.
  Peak heap rises about 12 MB on a 112 MB istanbul artifact.
- The first churn read after a commit (next-item, worklist, brief) folds in only the new
  commits, from a new `.crapkit/churn-commits-v1.json` that keeps the churn window's
  commits. On a 73k-commit window, where the file is about 9.4 MB, the map's CPU after a
  20-commit HEAD move went from 1.84 s to 0.88 s. A rewritten history, another window, a
  shallow clone, a damaged file or a cutoff that moved back rebuilds in full. After a
  HEAD move, brief and `worklist --batches` spawn git 3 times instead of 6.
- The churn log is walked from the HEAD its key names, so a commit that lands during the
  walk is no longer counted twice. When git's `N months ago` cutoff moves back at a
  month end (6 months before Aug 31 is Mar 3, before Sep 1 is Mar 1), the log is walked
  again instead of re-dated. A path's churn weight is summed with math.fsum, so a
  carried commit table and a cold rebuild round alike.

### verify names a failure that passed its retry

- A new failure that passes its flake retry is named on the OK line as `(1 new failure
  passed on rerun, first ID)` and in a new `--json` key `retried_passes`. It no longer
  counts among the unchanged failures forgiven, which now lists only failures the
  baseline also has.
- A failure passes its flake retry only when every lane that failed it reran it and
  passed it. A second lane that failed the same id with no `retest_command` used to be
  passed over, and verify exited 0.
- `dirty_failures` no longer names a failure that passed its retry; it stays a subset of
  `new_failures`.
- A verify that passed only because a test passed its retry no longer forgives that
  test's later real failure when it serves as the baseline. The stored run names those
  ids under each lane's `retried_passes`, and `failures` keeps the lane's own report.
- `verify --base` and `hook-precommit --base` say `no merge base between REF and HEAD`
  when git finds none, and in a shallow clone add `set fetch-depth: 0 on the checkout or
  run git fetch --unshallow`.

### A lane that lists its inputs is reused across commits

- `coverage --reuse-unchanged` and `verify --reuse-unchanged` reuse a lane that lists
  its `inputs` while the commit its artifact was built at is still behind HEAD, no
  committed, staged, unstaged or untracked change touches those paths, the artifact
  bytes match, and the lane's own table, `env` included, is the one it was measured
  with. Lanes without `inputs` keep the same-clean-HEAD rule. Entries are literal paths
  from the root, spelled like scope paths; one holding `*` or `?`, or one that is
  absolute or climbs out of the root, is a config error. An entry that matches no
  tracked file, and no untracked file outside `.gitignore`, such as `scr` for `src`,
  still loads, and `doctor` fails on it: reuse would see no change through it. The
  reuse line ends with the commit the artifact was built at: `(artifact built at
  1a2b3c4d5e6)`.
- An istanbul lane that sets `path_prefix` no longer hides a measured path from another
  tree: the wrong-tree check takes the prefix back off coverage.py keys only.
- `--reuse-unchanged` says why a lane reruns. Each lane gets one stderr line, `lane 'x':
  rerunning: <reason>` naming the first condition that failed (no artifact, a stamp
  with no proof, uncommitted changes, a moved HEAD, crapkit.toml, the lane table, the
  environment variables that changed, changes under `inputs`, artifact bytes), and
  `coverage --json` carries it as `lanes.<name>.rerun_reason`. A declined reuse used to
  print nothing, on a large consumer repo a rerun of up to 88 minutes. A partial run on
  a dirty tree says its hinted `--reuse-unchanged` reruns every lane without `inputs`.
- A `cd` between two runs no longer reruns every lane: the proof leaves out `OLDPWD`,
  `PWD`, `SHLVL`, `_` and terminal session ids. The stamp keeps a digest of each other
  variable, never its value, so the rerun line names the one that changed.
- A lane artifact or results file git does not ignore no longer blocks reuse. It left
  the tree dirty after every run, so no stamp held a proof and every lane reran: 12 of
  12 lanes on a large consumer repo whose Python lane writes an untracked coverage JSON.
  The declared outputs of every lane in `crapkit.toml` are not changes; each stamp
  proves its own by digest.

### doctor checks a lane the way the lane starts

- doctor's start check, version report and pytest-cov probe ran under doctor's own PATH
  and directory. They now run from the lane's `cwd` with its `[lane.env]` merged in, and
  a lane whose own PATH carries a python with pytest-cov no longer FAILs doctor.
- A lane headed by a relative launcher such as `.venv\Scripts\python.exe` FAILed doctor
  from the repo root and passed from a subdirectory. doctor gives the same finding from
  anywhere under the root and names the absolute file. On Windows it finds a bare lane
  word the way cmd.exe does: the lane's `cwd` first unless
  `NoDefaultCurrentDirectoryInExePath` is set, then each PATH entry with each PATHEXT
  extension.
- `doctor --json`, `doctor --tune` and MCP `check_config` crashed with an AttributeError
  when `.crapkit/artifacts.json` held an entry that is not an object. doctor reads such
  an entry as no stamp and WARNs, naming the lane whose next run replaces it, or saying
  to delete one no declared lane writes.
- `doctor --tune` finds a lane's duration after its artifact path changed, as the lane
  start order does.
- After a lane failed for want of pytest-cov, the hint named no interpreter for chained
  commands such as `cd web && python -m pytest --cov=src`. It names the python heading
  the pytest step, with its `-m pip install pytest-cov` line.
- With pytest before 9.1, a lane whose test errored in teardown was refused as a partial
  report. JUnit admission accepts either total pytest declares: records before 9.1,
  testcases from 9.1 on.
- A lane attempt that failed to start writes its reason into the lane log, so a retried
  lane's log no longer runs one attempt's output into the next attempt's header.
- init and doctor read a backslash in a git-listed name as part of the filename, not as
  a directory separator.

### Windows starts an owned command with no launcher in between

- Windows starts an owned command suspended and resumes it once its Job holds it, with
  no Python launcher in between. Each owned command runs one process fewer and costs
  about 47-62 ms less CPU; an MCP tool call saves one interpreter start.
- A command that exits 0xC0000142 (STATUS_DLL_INIT_FAILED) is the lane layer's retry
  trigger, as a launcher that died at spawn was. An owned command's NTSTATUS exit code,
  such as 0xC0000005, reaches the caller unchanged; the launcher turned every code above
  2^31 into 4294967295. A worktree teardown whose git failed to start still falls back
  to removing the directory.
- Every owned command raises that start failure instead of returning an exit code, not
  only a lane: MCP tool calls, test-scoped runners and git worktree commands included.
  `crapkit test-scoped` exits 5 and names the failure, where it exited 1 with `runner
  exit 4294967295`, and an MCP tool call answers a JSON-RPC error (-32603) naming it
  instead of an `isError` result. A shell string raises it when its last process
  failed to start, even after earlier steps ran.

### `crapkit clean` recovers mutations only

- `crapkit clean` recovers abandoned temporary mutation checkouts and no longer touches
  test evidence. `clean --json` keeps its `test_runs` object with every array empty. On
  a linked `.crapkit`, clean refuses with mutation recovery's sentence; the exit stays
  5.
- Test evidence retention moved to crapkit's development runner, the only writer of
  `.crapkit/test-runs`. `tools/testing/run.py` prunes finished default runs at each
  start by `--retention-days` (default 7) and `--retention-count` (default 10); a
  negative or non-integer value exits 2. `--preview-retention` prints what the limits
  would remove and runs no suite.
- An expired run the filesystem will not fully delete keeps its receipt, so the preview
  still lists it and the next start tries again. It used to abort the prune, and with it
  every default development test run and `crapkit clean` before mutation recovery.

### Found installing the release candidate from scratch

- A green verify on a Windows checkout under `core.autocrlf=true` rewrote a CRLF marks
  file as LF and printed `ratchet: restamped -> git add crapkit-ratchet.tsv` over a diff
  git showed as empty, and `--json` counted `{"dropped": 0, "tightened": 0}`. A text that
  differs only in line endings now leaves the file alone, and a real write keeps the
  file's own line ending.
- `diff_uncovered_max` counts the lines of a changed file no lane artifact mentions,
  such as a new module no test imports: every line of its functions, which score flag
  `untested`. Such a file was skipped, so a pull request adding one passed a ceiling of 0
  with no warning. Its lines outside any function still do not count.
- `doctor --tune` suggested `max_parallel_lanes = 2` for two pytest-cov lanes started
  from one directory, the per-testpath shape lanes.md recommends. Both write coverage.py's
  `.coverage` there, and run at once one of them intermittently died with
  `sqlite3.OperationalError: table coverage_schema already exists`, leaving the run
  partial. `--tune` now holds the suggestion at 1 and names the lanes, `doctor` WARNs
  about them when `max_parallel_lanes` is above 1, and the testpath stubs `init` writes
  each set `env = { COVERAGE_FILE = ".coverage.<lane>" }`. Both checks also catch a lane
  left on `.coverage` beside a lane on `.coverage.b`: pytest-cov deletes and combines
  every `.coverage.*` beside a lane's data file, and run at once one of the two failed
  with `PermissionError: [WinError 32]` on the other's piece. A lane command's own
  `--data-file` counts as its data file.
- `next-item`'s item and `get_next_item`'s output schema carry `occurrence`, as
  docs/agent-json.md always showed. The key was missing since 0.7.0.
- The MCP output schemas declare every field their results carry: `occurrence` on
  `list_worklist` rows, `get_function_brief`'s `scored` and `file_functions[]` and
  `check_gate`'s `functions[]`, `handle` on `list_worklist` rows, and an integer value for
  each path in `check_gate`'s `gate.ceilings`. The worklist example and field list in
  docs/agent-json.md show `handle` and `occurrence`.
- `ratchet seed` and `prune` on a store whose only run is a failed verify name that
  verify, as they do once a coverage run stands behind it. They said to run `crapkit
  coverage` first, and after it that a fresh coverage would only be refused the same way.
  verify on a store whose only runs are partial names the lanes the newest one went
  without, where it said to run `crapkit coverage` while a failing lane kept every run
  partial.
- The Action's comment, when every lane failed, says `(every lane failed (1 of 1); the
  lane errors are in the job log)`. It quoted the CLI's `the errors are above`, and
  nothing sits above that line in a pull request comment.
- `verify --override ""` is refused with exit 3 before any lane runs, as a blank reason
  now is too. It ran as a plain verify and recorded the failure it was meant to grant,
  which held later runs back as tainted.
- The README's Route 1 says git refuses every commit when the hook file starts with a
  byte-order mark (measured on git 2.43 for Windows, exit 1, HEAD unchanged). It said
  git let the commit through. Writing the hook as ASCII is still the fix.
- The README quotes the advisory hook's costs with the platform they were measured on:
  68 ms for the no-op in a repo with no `crapkit.toml` through the Windows launcher,
  where it promised under 50 ms, and about 50 ms for the Bash matcher's two git spawns
  on Windows, where it said 30.
- A lane that leaves both its artifact and its results file behind says `the
  .crapkit/cov/py.json and .crapkit/cov/junit-py.xml on disk predate it and are the
  previous run's`, where it read `the .crapkit/cov/py.json, .crapkit/cov/junit-py.xml on
  disk predates it and is the previous run's`.
- The printed transcripts follow the CLI again: each `doctor` report opens with its
  `resources:` line, the quickstarts' `verify OK` lines end with the `ratchet: 1 dropped,
  0 tightened -> git add crapkit-ratchet.tsv` those steps print, the restamp example in
  docs/ratchet.md ends with `ratchet: restamped`, the TypeScript `rescore --gate` block
  ends with its `gate:` line, the `.crapkit/` listing names `measurement.lock`, and the
  refusal for an `fnMap` entry without `decl` names its artifact. The TypeScript quickstart says why the
  first `doctor` WARNs about `[crapkit.scoped_tests]`.
- On Windows the hook override's receipt names `unset CRAPKIT_OVERRIDE_REASON` for Git
  Bash beside the PowerShell and cmd.exe forms. Git Bash is where most Windows users run
  git, and neither printed form works there. The hook cannot tell the shell apart: git for
  Windows sets `MSYSTEM` and `SHELL` for it whichever shell started the commit.
- The Action blames a fork's read-only token for a failed comment post only when the pull
  request comes from another repository. Bad credentials, a missing `gh` and a job
  without `pull-requests: write` were all told they came from a fork; they now read `gh's
  own error is above`.

### The advisory hook reads encoded marks, and report commands paste into cmd.exe

- The advisory hook honours a ratchet mark written as an encoded record (a path that
  starts with `#`, or holds a tab, a line break or a Unicode separator), and a legacy
  raw mark whose path starts with `#` no longer silences the advisory for other files.
- The HTML report's explain commands paste intact into cmd.exe as well as PowerShell and
  sh. A path that starts with a hyphen is passed after `--`, a handle holding a double
  quote goes through the encoded PowerShell line, and a long encoded line wraps in its
  cell instead of widening the table.
- The help for `mutate --files` and `claims release PATH` says the path is repo-relative
  and read from the working directory without `--repo`.

### CI, tests and release tooling

- CI runs each Windows suite as its own job and measures the verdict's base and
  candidate in two parallel jobs (`tools/testing/ci.py --measure base|candidate`). A
  join job (`--join`) checks each uploaded wheel against its recorded bytes and commit,
  reinstalls it and proves its source before verifying. A measurement that stops before
  its hand-off uploads `failure.json` with the phase and the error. A newer push to a
  pull request cancels the older run; pushes to main always finish.
  `tools/testing/run.py --suite unit` or `--suite e2e` runs one session, judged by
  junitparse's rules.
- Every test-side wait on a child goes through `tests/hang_guard.py`: one 120 s bound
  that a wait leaves the moment its state appears, and a miss that kills the child and
  fails with what it printed. Six tests had failed verify on a correct tree while the
  machine was saturated, each on a guessed bound of 5 to 30 s. A child that holds a lock
  until the test releases it holds for three bounds.
- tests/e2e runs a CLI call inside the pytest worker unless its file binds
  `cli_runner(spawn=True)`, and builds a measured fixture repo once per xdist worker. On
  a 24-core Windows machine the e2e suite used 20 to 22% less CPU and started 3,825
  fewer processes. An in-process call past its bound fails its own test with argv,
  output and stack, and the session goes on.
- mini_repo's py lane runs pytest with `-n 0`, and fixture lanes turn the suite's
  coverage off in their children. One `crapkit coverage` on mini_repo went from 6.73 to
  1.30 s of CPU, and from 8.50 to 1.36 s with the suite's own coverage on.
- Releasing: stage 1 no longer runs the full coverage lane, `ratchet seed` or `ratchet
  prune`. After a passing verify, the verify stage runs seed and prune against that run
  and stops the release, with the marks file put back, when either would change it, so a
  release runs one full py lane instead of two. `release.py check` refuses only a
  release interpreter that cannot import build or twine and a missing PyPI credential.
  `release.py verify` prints `unconfirmed (cannot run gh: ...)` or `unreachable (not the
  version JSON: ...)` instead of a traceback, and a staged rename out of a path starting
  `# ` reads as a dirty tree. `verify` gives the MCP registry search 120 s, because a
  search on a cold registry cache took 78 to 87 s and a 20 s read called a correct entry
  unconfirmed. `run glama VERSION` prints the manual Sync Server step, and an unknown
  stage is refused with every stage `plan` prints.
- The dependency-venv fixture carries every site directory the parent imports from, so
  the throwaway-venv tests pass under a `--system-site-packages` venv. The publish
  adapter retries readbacks without sleeping, 55 s off one unit test, and three release
  test files spawn git 1,425 times instead of 2,426.

## 0.7.6 — 2026-09-20

### A function on a shared line is told to split it, not to add tests

- 0.7.5 scores every function on a source line span it shares with another as
  uncovered, and still labelled the ones over their ceiling `add-tests`. No test can
  lower that score, because coverage cannot say whose is whose on such a span, so the
  advice could not be followed. Those functions now carry a fourth remedy,
  `split-lines`: put each definition on its own lines and measure again. The run after
  the split says whether tests are still owed.
- The rule covers a shared span no test reaches yet, since tests would only make it
  measured and therefore uncovered, and it covers `rescore`, the commit gate and
  `check_gate`, which derive the remedy on their own path. `decompose` still wins when
  complexity alone is over the ceiling, and a scope no lane measures keeps its advice.
- `split-lines` is stored at a fixed code like the other three, so a store copied
  between machines reads the same. A store written by an older release gains the code
  the first time this one opens it. Every MCP result schema that lists remedies lists
  the new one, so a client that validates structured results accepts it.

### Running it from a repo that is not Python

- The README now shows the path a TypeScript, Go or Rust repo takes: `uvx crapkit init`
  runs the tool from uv's own cache and adds nothing to the repo's manifest, and
  `uv tool install crapkit` or `pipx install crapkit` puts the command on PATH for the
  commit gate and the plugin.

### The docs site has a new address

- The handbook is served from https://www.jfgagne.com/crapkit/handbook.html over HTTPS.
  The old github.io address redirects there. The README, the package metadata, the
  registry manifest and the landing page's canonical link name the new address.

## 0.7.5 — 2026-09-15

### A source line two functions share no longer ends the coverage run

- Since 0.6.0 a `coverage` run refused, with exit 5, the moment it met two functions
  declared on one line span, because an artifact overlapping that span cannot say
  whose coverage is whose. One repository holds 591 such spans, 459 of them measured:
  every run died on the first one it met, so that repository finished no coverage run
  at all and its worklist, doctor and trend stayed as old as its last one.
- Every function on such a span now scores `untested` with coverage 0, which is the
  honest floor and never the number a neighbour's measurement carries. The run
  continues and names on stderr how many spans it met, plus the path and line of
  those holding a function its ceiling fails at zero coverage, which is what
  splitting the definitions onto separate lines measures.
- Only functions whose coverage was ambiguous change. A function of complexity 2 or
  less cannot score above a ceiling of 6 even at zero coverage: of the 925 functions
  on that repository's shared spans, 898 are in that class.

### Release maintenance

- The registry stage logs in with `gh auth token` and publishes straight after, so
  it no longer waits on GitHub's device flow; the command echo never shows the token.
- A readback of a surface that was just written waits up to 55 seconds before the
  stage records it unconfirmed.

## 0.7.4 — 2026-09-15

A Python function lizard stopped reading inside its own signature is scored on its
whole body, and three measurement defects are fixed. The twelve MCP tools, JSON
schema version 1 and analysis version 10 remain compatible with 0.7.0; the only
scores that move are those of the functions described in the first section.

### A Python function whose signature runs past its first `)` is scored on its whole body

- lizard 1.24.0 ended a Python function inside its own signature in three shapes: a
  return annotation opened on the def line and closed on a later one (`-> tuple[`
  then `]:`), a line break after a parameter default that holds brackets
  (`bases=(),` or `skip=frozenset(),`), which is how black and ruff wrap a long
  signature, and a backslash continuation before the return annotation (`) \`
  then `-> ...:`). The function read as two lines at ccn 1 whatever its body held,
  so the complexity ceiling, the commit hook, `rescore --gate` and `verify` passed
  it. crapkit now reads these signatures to the colon that opens the body (#72).
- After upgrading, the ccn, CRAP score, end line, nloc and cognitive score of those
  functions rise to what their bodies hold, and one that now sits over the ceiling
  fails the gate the next time its file changes. Measured over 45,000 Python files
  from the standard library, installed packages and application code, about one
  function in 400 read this way; every other function reads exactly as before,
  apart from the functions nested in or enclosing them.
- The long name of such a function stays as lizard spelled it, stopping at the
  signature's first `)` (`make( cls_name , * , bases = ( )`), so its ratchet key does
  not change.
- A function nested inside one of them now carries its parent's name
  (`outer.inner( a )` where it read `inner( a )`), and the parent's ccn falls by the
  conditions lizard had charged to it from the nested body. A ratchet mark recorded
  under the nested function's old name matches no function any more, and
  `crapkit ratchet prune` drops it.
- A Python file with a def no reader finishes, such as a nested def cut off at the
  end of the file, is named on stderr and scored as zero functions, like any file
  that could not be read, instead of scoring that def at ccn 1. The run goes on.
- Cached analysis records refresh on upgrade, because the cache key includes
  crapkit's version; the ratchet stamp is unchanged, so existing marks keep
  comparing.

### A launcher that dies at spawn fails its lane, not the whole command

- On Windows a lane's launcher can exit with code 3221225794 (0xC0000142,
  STATUS_DLL_INIT_FAILED) before it reads its start line, for example when the
  scheduler that started crapkit has ended its console. The start line then hit a
  dead pipe and `coverage` ended with a traceback. That lane now fails on its own
  with a message that names the exit code and says the command never ran; it is
  retried while it has retries left and the other lanes finish. `doctor` and
  `init` probes answer as before.

### doctor names a nearby test in the same language

- The warning that a directory's functions are all flagged untested while a test
  exists named the first same-named test anywhere in the repository, sorted by
  path, so it could point at a test in another tree or another language, and a
  file such as `docs/_mermaid_test.md` counted as a test. The example now comes, in
  order, from the directory itself, the nearest test below it, a `tests/` mirror,
  then a same-named test elsewhere, and at every step it has to be in the language
  of the code crapkit scored there. A directory with no such test gets no warning.

### Two runners in one repository no longer refuse each other's evidence

- On Windows, `Path.resolve()` names a directory a sibling process is creating or
  deleting in its extended-length form, or as the NTFS tombstone of a directory
  whose last handle is still open. Test evidence retention read both as a
  redirected `.crapkit/test-runs` and refused, so two direct runners sharing a
  repository failed one run in four. A symlink or junction elsewhere is still
  refused.

### Release maintenance

- `release.py run stage2b` checks the Pages build the way `release.py verify` does:
  a build at a later commit on main that carries the release commit confirms the
  release. A rerun after main moved past the tag used to record Pages as
  unconfirmed.

## 0.7.3 — 2026-09-11

`verify` says what it forgives, and the release chain proves the machine before it
publishes. Scoring, analysis version 10, the twelve MCP tools and JSON schema
version 1 remain compatible with 0.7.0.

### Three tool descriptions say more about their arguments

- `check_gate` states the forms `path` takes (repo-relative with forward slashes,
  or absolute inside the repo), that a path outside the repo or missing is a config
  error, and that a file no scope claims judges 0. `list_claims` and `list_runs`
  state how `repo` resolves (the server walks up to the nearest `crapkit.toml`)
  and the two pointers a checkout answers when it was never initialised or never
  scored. The other nine descriptions are unchanged.

### A missing path is refused, not crashed

- `rescore`, and so `check_gate`, refuse a file argument that does not exist with a
  config error naming it, exit 3. A typo reached the analyzer and came back as a
  `FileNotFoundError` traceback; through the MCP server that traceback was the
  whole answer.

### The verdict says what it forgives

- A `verify OK` line now names the failures the verdict forgives because the
  baseline carries them too. A regression verdict is about change, so an unchanged
  failure does not fail the run; reporting nothing about it made a suite with three
  failing tests read as clean.

## 0.7.2 — 2026-09-09

One unreadable file or one underflowed counter no longer ends a run. Scoring,
analysis version 10, the twelve MCP tools and JSON schema version 1 remain
compatible with 0.7.0. 0.7.1 was tagged and never published; it is contained
here.

### One bad file no longer ends the run

- A file no reader can tokenize is scored as the zero functions it holds, named
  on stderr, and left out of the analysis cache so the next run names it again.
  Through 0.7.0 the first refusal raised, so one ambiguous TypeScript arrow in a
  corpus ended `coverage`, which left the ratchet unseeded and refused every
  commit in the repo, in every language. Refusing to read the arrow is still
  correct; ending the run over it was not.
- A negative derived branch count in an istanbul artifact clamps to 0 and is
  counted and named, rather than refusing the artifact. `@vitest/coverage-v8`
  takes an else-path as `parent - if`, and that subtraction underflows on
  remapped output. Measured hit counts (`f` and `s`) stay strict, where a
  negative is corruption rather than arithmetic.

### Test schedule

- Give each nested test run its own pytest cache, and name a mutation shard's
  evidence by its writer rather than by the clock. Concurrent runners in one
  repository staged and deleted `pytest-cache-files-*` under a peer's collector,
  and `time.time_ns()` is a 15.625 ms tick on Windows before CPython 3.13, so two
  shards recording inside one tick overwrote each other's evidence.

## 0.7.1 — 2026-09-08

This release fixes process cleanup and bounds retained resources while keeping
small analysis calls on the serial path. Scoring, analysis version 10,
the twelve MCP tools and JSON schema version 1 remain compatible with 0.7.0.

### Process lifetime

- Stop active MCP tool descendants on cancellation or client disconnect, and
  keep protocol control messages responsive during a tool call. Admit one active
  tool per connection and return a retry message for overlapping tool calls.
- Close mutation admission on interruption before joining workers, preventing
  another suite from starting after cancellation. Own Git checkout preparation
  and cleanup commands as well as the mutation suites.
- Apply command ownership to scoped tests, watch subprocesses and the shared
  development test runner. A completed suite cannot leave a background writer
  alive when the next suite starts.
- Retain analysis pool capacity until the actual workers exit, including
  caller and guardian failure paths.
- Skip POSIX process-table scans when the kernel confirms an owned group is
  already gone; retain descriptor-closure checks for groups that still exist.

### Resource policies

- Move measurement locks outside report directories so runners can delete and
  recreate their output directories on Windows. Coordinate shared artifact paths
  across repositories for the same user and host, independent of temporary and
  analysis-resource directories. Retain small stable lease files as coordination
  state. Cross-user or cross-host writers now need external serialization or
  distinct artifacts; finish old-version measurements before upgrading.
- Coordinate analysis pool slots across processes for the same user and host.
  Respect CPU affinity, configured worker ceilings and the inherited memory
  sizing hint. Contention takes available slots or falls back to serial work;
  small and cached passes avoid the shared admission path.
- Cap pools by runnable chunks so idle workers are not started. Send compact
  slot descriptors during worker startup to avoid oversized bootstrap writes
  on Windows. Size automatic spawn pools to amortize startup across useful work;
  explicit worker requests retain their configured ceiling.
- Add `analysis_worker_budget` and report effective resource settings through
  `doctor --json`. The budget covers Crapkit pool workers; external test
  runners retain their own worker controls.
- Bound each lane log and its single rotated backup to 16 MiB by default.
  Preserve byte progress across rotations and the newest failure output.
  Set `log_max_bytes = 0` to keep unlimited logs.
- Retain recognized default test-run evidence for seven days and ten recent
  runs. Configure either limit or disable it with zero. Active runs, explicit
  output directories and unrecognized evidence remain untouched.
- Trim surplus retained mutation workers on reuse. Record ownership of new
  temporary mutation checkouts and recover abandoned runs under exclusive
  leases. Add `clean --dry-run --json` to preview cleanup and `clean --json`
  to perform it. Older unmarked system-temp checkouts remain untouched.

### Release maintenance

- Keep cleanup fixtures inside the tested Python environment, accept an unset
  `PYTHONPATH`, and disable automatic Git maintenance while building copyable
  test repositories.
- Redistribute pending tests when parallel workers finish early, keeping the
  existing unit and end-to-end worker counts and complete coverage collection.
- Require recorded passing tests, valid test counts and artifact digests before
  publication, including when a regression verdict accepts unchanged failures.
- Measure each installed wheel with its own revision's test runner and record
  the runner hash. Linux CI stops and reaps descendants of historical runners
  before retaining evidence or removing scratch checkouts.
- Permit release preparation from clean local main that includes current
  origin/main. Publication still requires the exact tagged commit and a fresh
  passing full verification receipt, so fixes need no preliminary push.
- Confirm the canonical MCP Registry server, repository and PyPI package across
  all search pages. Refuse duplicate latest records and incomplete pagination.

See [resource policies](https://github.com/JeanFrancoisGagne/crapkit/blob/v0.7.1/docs/resources.md)
for defaults, opt-outs and platform scope.

## 0.7.0 — 2026-09-07

This release makes scoring, verification and concurrent work more reliable. It
preserves literal file paths, separates same-line callbacks, requires complete
measurement evidence, and bounds retained duplicate candidates. The CLI, MCP tool names
and JSON schema version remain compatible with 0.6.0.

### Upgrade notes

- Analysis version 10 invalidates older analysis caches. Refresh coverage after
  upgrading. If verification reports an older metric stamp, follow the
  [ratchet upgrade and identity checks](https://github.com/JeanFrancoisGagne/crapkit/blob/v0.7.0/docs/ratchet.md#the-metric-stamp)
  before reseeding; ambiguous legacy callback marks are preserved and refused,
  never silently assigned to another function.
- Ratchets, scored/inventory exports and portable baselines retain ordinary TSV.
  Fields containing tabs or line separators, or a leading `#` path, use a versioned JSON
  record. Consumers that parse these files directly must support the
  [portable record format](https://github.com/JeanFrancoisGagne/crapkit/blob/v0.7.0/docs/portable-records.md).
- Configuration now rejects duplicate scope or lane names, invalid numeric and
  boolean values, and coverage/JUnit paths that refer to the same output file.
  Coverage parsers refuse impossible counts and nonfinite values.
- The MCP server still exposes twelve tools. They inspect scores and check edited
  functions without claiming queue items or running verification. Calls can update
  local caches and store metadata; documentation and listings now state that scope.

### Scoring, identity and reports

- Keep same-line callbacks distinct in stored rows, packets, exports, claims and
  history. Separate JavaScript and TypeScript expression arrows that the upstream
  reader merged. Anonymous callback migration requires reader proof; unproved
  claims hold their name group until released, explicitly pruned, or the whole
  group is healthy.
- Bind analysis and cache identity to the source bytes, language reader and typed
  expression mode. Reject ambiguous same-span coverage instead of borrowing a
  sibling's coverage. Treat malformed disposable caches as misses.
- Use one scope ownership rule throughout scoring, setup, packets and scoped
  tests. A root scope (`paths = ["."]`) has lower precedence than deeper paths.
- Preserve exact Git filenames and source line endings. Gate and advisory paths
  share a fixed patch format, independent of user diff settings. GitHub Action
  inputs preserve NUL-delimited changed paths, Markdown metacharacters and Unicode;
  SARIF paths are URI-encoded and decoded once.
- Make duplicate ranking deterministic across input order and hash seeds. Limit
  positive `--top` rankings with a bounded heap and construct payloads only for
  returned matches. On the recorded 600-clone fixture, top-1 time fell from
  598 ms to 204 ms and peak memory from 147.7 MB to 0.87 MB. These are fixture
  measurements, not a whole-project speed claim.
- Read coverage contexts only for the requested file. Preserve debt age when a
  committed mark changes value and audit overrides under the exact canonical key.

### Verification and concurrent execution

- Require complete, fresh JUnit evidence. Collection failures, crashed workers and
  incomplete sessions cannot pass as successful coverage; retries need explicit
  passing results before clearing a failure.
- Use the final settled verdict for the process exit, JSON response, stored run and
  trusted-baseline decision. Preserve failed-run evidence and identity witnesses
  when pruning history, and leave concurrent new runs intact.
- Reuse measurements only when the clean HEAD, configuration, environment and
  coverage/JUnit bytes match. Keep command outputs owned until the process tree
  has stopped and parsing has finished.
- Own command descendants with process groups on POSIX and Job Objects on Windows.
  Retain ownership through completion, timeout and caller termination. Untimed
  commands remain untimed, and launch errors retain their original meaning.
  Wait for Windows process completion before releasing output locks; a zero Job
  accounting count can arrive before the processes finish exiting.
- Give mutation workers one captured source, test and configuration snapshot,
  including dirty files and deletions. Refuse linked source files before writing,
  isolate worker copies, and preserve active workers during cleanup. Generate
  mutants from executable tokens rather than words inside names or comments.
- Reserve queue items atomically and preserve state across concurrent ratchet
  writers. Current stores open without repeating migration writes.
- Format packet and retry commands for their host shell while preserving literal
  arguments. Emit MCP text as UTF-8. Report failed doctor probes as failures,
  without substituting the current interpreter's version.

### Development, CI and release maintenance

- Share one test runner across development, coverage and CI: four unit workers and
  eight E2E workers, with explicit serial reproduction controls. Reuse pristine
  fixture seeds through private copies and remove a duplicate hosted source suite.
- Require fresh JUnit artifacts and preserve logs and verdicts on failure. Compare
  separately installed base and candidate wheels, validate their source provenance,
  and retain historical baseline failures without excusing candidate regressions.
- Gate CI changes against the event base and isolate each composite Action run.
  Establish cleanup fixture readiness before measuring its deadline, while
  keeping separate tests for startup and whole-call deadlines.
  Release ownership test fixtures explicitly so slow competitor startup cannot
  turn correct lock acquisition into a test failure.
- Bind release publication to a clean tagged HEAD and a passing verification ledger
  row. Build wheel and source archives once, record their hashes, publish only
  missing matching artifacts, and confirm PyPI, GitHub and Pages through readback.
  Regenerate supported-version guidance before release coverage and check it on
  the tagged tree.
- Document marketplace installation and upgrades for Claude Code and Codex,
  including checks against the CLI used by each installed plugin.
- Remove unused discovery code and production copies of reference algorithms.
  CLI helpers live with their owning command families; `crapkit.cli.main` remains
  the public entry point.
- Refresh installation and upgrade guidance, command lifecycle documentation,
  contributor workflows, security details and website navigation.

The [implementation report](https://github.com/JeanFrancoisGagne/crapkit/blob/v0.7.0/docs/architecture/2026-09-07-implementation/REPORT.md)
contains the architecture findings, measured costs and gains, test results and
retained evidence.

## 0.6.0 — 2026-09-05

### The MCP tools follow one naming pattern, carry titles and output schemas, and two read tools join

Every tool is renamed to `verb_noun`, where the verb says what a call returns: `get_` one
item, `list_` a ranking or a set, `check_` a verdict. An MCP client that pinned a 0.5.x
tool name has to be updated; the CLI subcommands do not move.

| 0.5.x | 0.6.0 |
| --- | --- |
| `next_item` | `get_next_item` |
| `worklist` | `list_worklist` |
| `runs` | `list_runs` |
| `brief` | `get_function_brief` |
| `explain` | `get_function_history` |
| `doctor` | `check_config` |
| `coupling` | `list_coupled_files` |
| `duplication` | `list_duplicate_functions` |
| `ratchet_report` | `get_ratchet_report` |
| `gate` | `check_gate` |

Two read tools are new: `get_trend` (per-run totals for every trusted run, the CLI's
`trend --json`) and `list_claims` (the open claims sessions hold on queue items, the CLI's
`claims list --json`). No tool writes: `crapkit claims release` stays a CLI command.

Every tool now serves a `title` and an `outputSchema` whose fields are described one by
one, so a client reads the result shape from the definition instead of guessing it from
prose. The descriptions are rewritten to say what a tool returns, when to call it and which
sibling to call instead, what a call reads and costs, and what each argument means beyond
its type. The annotations gain `destructiveHint: false` beside `readOnlyHint`,
`idempotentHint` and `openWorldHint`, and the server's `instructions` name the four tools a
session starts with.

Contract tests pin the pattern: every name is `verb_noun` on one of the three verbs, every
title is longer than its name, every documented output field appears in the served schema,
every description names a sibling and stays under 560 characters.

### Upgrading from 0.5.x

MCP clients that call tools by name (Claude Code's `mcp__...` tool ids included) apply the
table above. Argument names, types and result payloads are unchanged, so a renamed call
returns what the old one did. `crapkit mcp` still serves on stdio and the plugin's
`.mcp.json` needs no edit.

## 0.5.1 — 2026-09-05

### `verify` counts the standing debt no mark covers

The gate judges touched functions only and the ratchet check compares marks only, so an
over-ceiling function that carries no mark is guarded by nothing: coverage loss on it
passes a green verify. `verify` now prints `warning: N function(s) over the ceiling carry
no ratchet mark, so a rise on them (coverage loss included) passes unseen; record them
with `crapkit ratchet seed`` on stderr and carries the count as `unmarked_over_target` in
`--json`. No exit code changes. Silent at zero: a header-only marks file is the correct
state of a repo with no debt, and crapkit's own is one. Whether an empty marks file means
"no debt" or "seed never ran" is now one line on every run.

### README answers the two questions every evaluator asks first

Why the ceiling is 6 and not crap4j's conventional 30, and how a repo with existing debt
adopts crapkit without raising it: `ratchet seed` marks today's over-ceiling functions,
the gate then judges only the functions a change touches, and marks may only fall.
[docs/comparison.md](docs/comparison.md) gains crap4py beside radon, xenon, wily and
SonarQube.

### The registry manifest names its repository and website

`server.json` declares `repository` (GitHub) and `websiteUrl`, so the MCP Registry entry
and every aggregator that reads it can link back to the source instead of showing no
repository and an unknown license. Pinned by a contract test. The registry refuses a
republish of an existing version, so the fields reach it with this release.

## 0.5.0 — 2026-09-03

The seventeen repairs from the seven-seat review of 0.4.15 (spec: docs/specs/2026-09-03-release-0.5.0.md, issue #58). Subsections land per slice below.

### The Action says why the base run was not made, and `gate: "true"` fails a pull request that judged nothing

On `actions/checkout`'s default depth-1 clone the Action's base step made no run, `verify`
judged the checkout against its own run (an empty diff), the comment said `verify passed`,
and `gate: "true"` exited 0 on a pull request that exits 6 at full depth. The base step now
writes the reason to `crapkit-base.reason` on every failure path: `shallow clone does not
hold the fork point of <sha>; set fetch-depth: 0 on the checkout`, `no usable crapkit.toml
at the fork point <sha>: ...`, or `lane failed at the fork point <sha>: ...` with the lane's
first error line. The comment renders `**verify judged no changed function:** the base run
was not made (<reason>)` in place of `verify passed`, with `no base commit` as the reason on
a `push` event and under `delta: "false"`. With `gate: "true"` the exit step exits 1 when the
base run was attempted on a pull request and not made, printing the reason; a `push` and
`delta: "false"` never attempt it and keep `verify`'s own code. The renderer stays git-free:
the sha and the reason reach `tools/action/comment.py` as `--base-sha` and `--base-reason`
files. Moved contracts: the README's `gate` and `delta` input rows, and the "What the
verdict line covers" passage that said none of the three failures fails the job.

### The Action does not ask verify for a verdict over a failed coverage

The verdict step ran `crapkit verify --json --reuse-artifacts` whatever `crapkit coverage`
had exited. On a runner that keeps its workspace between jobs (`clean: false`), a lane that
stopped writing its artifact was refused by `coverage` (exit 5) and then `verify` read the
artifact that lane had left from an earlier run, passed over it, and `runs list` showed
that run as the trusted baseline. The checkout step now records coverage's exit, the verdict
step reads it first and does not call `verify` when it is non-zero, and the comment says
`` **no verdict: `crapkit coverage` exited 5 (lane 'py' failed: <first line of the lane
failure>); verify did not run.** ``, quoting the error object's message when `coverage --json`
died before a summary, or pointing at the job log when every lane failed and nothing was
printed. `gate: "true"` then exits with coverage's code. The renderer takes the code as
`--coverage-exit`.

### The pull-request comment names the function and the rule that failed the check

On exit 6 the comment read `1 gate violation, 0 ratchet regressions, ...` over a table in
which the pull request's own untested `route()` and an untouched ratchet-marked
`legacy_router()` were two identical rows, and on exit 9 the ceiling and the uncovered lines
were only in the job log. The verdict now opens with the rule the exit code stands for,
`**verify failed, exit 6: complexity gate.**` (7 `ratchet regressions`, 8 `new test failures`,
9 `diff-coverage ceiling 3`, the ceiling read from the receipt's `diff_uncovered_max`), then
one bullet per finding: `` - gate: `app/calc.py:34` `route( a , b , c , d )` ccn 8, cov 0%,
crap 72.0 -> decompose ``, `` - ratchet: `app/calc.py` `legacy_router( ... )` 72.0 -> 80.5
(recorded -> fresh) ``, `` - new test failure: `tests/test_calc.py::test_route` ``, and the first
twenty uncovered changed lines as `` - uncovered lines in `app/calc.py`: 35, 36, ... `` with one
bullet per file and `- and N more uncovered changed lines` for the rest. The counts line
closes the block unchanged. In the table, a row whose function the committed ratchet carries
a mark for (the worklist row's `ratchet_mark`) reads `decompose (accepted debt)`, and the
rows a finding names come first, ahead of the `top` cap. Moved contract: the README's
rendered comment is now the byte-for-byte render of the payloads under
`tests/fixtures/action_comment/` (a failing example), pinned by the unit suite.

### The comment's scored line names the ceiling, a failed lane's first line, or the error

The first line of the pull-request comment read `153 over target` with no number, while the
scopes carried ceilings 4, 6 and 12, and a `coverage --json` that died before printing a
summary left the comment with `wrote no run summary` and the sentence naming the fix in the
job log. The line now reads `2 over ceiling 6` or `2 over their ceilings (6; reports 12,
util 4)` from the summary's `ceilings`, appends `; lane 'js' failed: <first line>` for each
entry of `lane_failures`, and, when the payload is the one-object error `--json` prints on
a crapkit error, reads `` `crapkit coverage` exited 5: <message> ``. A 0.4.x payload without
`ceilings` reads `over the ceiling`. The verdict line reads the same error object from
`verify --json` (a missing baseline commit, exit 4) as `` **`crapkit verify` exited 4 and
wrote no verdict: <message>.** `` instead of counting it as a verdict with no findings.
Moved contract: the README's rendered comment is regenerated with the new first line.

### The MCP server survives a bad call

A `tools/call` with a missing positional, an undeclared key or a wrong type answers a tool result with `isError: true` in the tool's own words (`brief needs name (see inputSchema.required)`, `worklist does not take 'bogus'; accepted: repo, top, scope`, `top must be an integer (got "three")`) before any CLI spawns, and the session continues; on 0.4.15 a missing positional killed the server and every later request read end of file. `params: null` and `arguments: null` are refusals, not crashes, and a positional sent as `null` is a missing positional (`brief needs path (see inputSchema.required)`), not a spawned CLI's stderr. `tools/list` declares `required` from each tool's positionals. `ping` answers an empty result instead of `-32601`. An exception escaping the server answers a JSON-RPC `-32603` reply and the loop reads on. ADR 0001 records why the refusals are tool results and not the protocol's `-32602`.

### explain and doctor answer JSON over MCP

Both tools shell to their `--json` form, so all nine tools return one shape and carry `structuredContent` whenever the CLI exits 0. `explain` takes `history` and `tests` (booleans; true adds `commits` and `tests` to each function, the CLI's `--history` and `--tests`). A `doctor` that finds a FAIL exits 1 and answers its JSON text with `isError: true` and no `structuredContent`. Moved contracts: the two MCP e2e asserts that read `no problems found` from the doctor tool now read `problems: []`; the two "plain text" rows leave the MCP tables in docs/agent-json.md and AGENTS.md, and the agents guide's `initialize reports protocol 2024-11-05` line, stale since 0.4.13, names the negotiated revisions.

### worklist and next_item take a scope over MCP

Both tools accept `scope`, an array of declared scope names, one `--scope` each, so a large repository is partitioned before `top` applies; the CLI's answer to the flags comes back as the tool's result.
### `mutate` never mutates a test
`crapkit mutate` placed mutants in every file the diff touched, tests included: on one review run 6 of 9 mutants landed in `tests/test_tax.py` and the survivor was an assertion. The diff's file list, and the files `--files` names, now pass through the corpus predicate scoring uses (scopes, excludes, the test-file cut and `max_file_bytes`) before a mutant is placed. A file outside the corpus is named on stderr as `not mutating <path>: outside the scored corpus`, `--json` lists it under `outside_corpus`, and a diff with nothing left prints `mutation: nothing to mutate; outside the scored corpus (scopes, excludes, test files, max_file_bytes): <paths>` at exit 0 without starting the suite. A scope declaring `paths = ["."]` claims nothing in scoring and now claims nothing for `mutate` either; declare the files or directories by name, as `doctor` already asks.
### A Python row's `nesting` is a depth

`nesting` on a Python function is the deepest the cognitive pass's nesting stack gets, one level per `if`, `elif`, `else`, `for`, `while`, `except` and comprehension `for`, none for `with`, `try`, `finally`, `match`, `case` or a nested `def`: a flat function of seven `if`s reads 1 and a three-deep one reads 3. Until now the column read lizard's ND extension, which counts nesting structures for Python rather than depth, so the flat function read 7 and looked seven levels deep next to the same number for a function that was. The same pass now reads which function owns a token after lizard has, so the first token of the line that leaves a Python function is no longer charged to it: an outer function whose blocks follow a nested helper keeps its own `cognitive` score and depth instead of handing the first of them to the helper, and the last function of a module no longer pays for the `if __name__ == "__main__":` or the module-level call that follows it (six of the 5,258 rows in crapkit's own tree move, by one point each); `ccn` does not move. Brace languages keep lizard's column. The analysis version moves to 9, so the first `inventory` or `coverage` after upgrading runs the analysis cache cold and re-measures the corpus once; the `nesting` row of `docs/agent-json.md` names the source per language and what opens a level. (#64)
### verify says why it refused an override

`verify --override` on a run holding a ratchet regression or a new test failure used to
exit 6 with no line about the override at all: no OVERRIDDEN, no refusal, an empty
`crapkit overrides`. It now prints one stderr line naming the cause and the escape,
`override refused: 1 ratchet regression (app/m.py pick( a ) 240.0 -> 380.0) never qualifies
for an override; raise the mark by hand and commit it`, both causes on the one line when a
run holds both. The exit code is unchanged and `--json` stdout stays one object.
docs/ratchet.md states the rule: a mark never rises through `verify`.

### verify says what it did to the marks file, and touches it only when something moved

A green run rewrote `crapkit-ratchet.tsv` on every pass, so a clean checkout ended with an
untracked marks file holding a stamp, a header and no rows, and a repo with marks got a
dirty file with nothing on the OK line to say why. The file is now written only when its
text would change and never created to hold zero marks. When it is written, the OK line
ends with `ratchet: 6 dropped, 1 tightened -> git add crapkit-ratchet.tsv`, and the JSON
receipt carries the same counts as `ratchet_changes` (`null` when the tighten wrote nothing).
A file written before stamping is rewritten once to gain its stamp line, and the OK line
says `ratchet: restamped -> git add crapkit-ratchet.tsv` for that rewrite. An override that
applied writes its grant to the same file, so its OK line ends with `ratchet: 1 mark granted
-> git add crapkit-ratchet.tsv`; `ratchet_changes` stays `null`, the grant being listed
under `overridden`.

### A shallow clone is named when the baseline commit is missing

`verify` on a depth-1 checkout said `is not an ancestor of HEAD (rebase or amend rewrote
history)` and sent the reader after a fresh baseline when nothing was rewritten. When
`git rev-parse --is-shallow-repository` answers true the line now reads `baseline commit
a74260f321f is not an ancestor of HEAD in this shallow clone, which does not hold it; set
fetch-depth: 0 on the checkout or run git fetch --unshallow`. Exit 4 and the rewrite message
on a full clone are unchanged; the README transcript shows the new line.

### The verify receipt carries the diff-coverage ceiling

`verify --json` adds `diff_uncovered_max`, the configured ceiling `diff_uncovered_count` is
judged against, `null` when the repo set none. Additive; `schema` stays 1.
### `init` writes a scoped-test command that collects a test, and `doctor` repeats its lane probe
A python scope whose own paths hold no test file gets the whole-suite form,
`python -m pytest tests -q -p no:cacheprovider`, naming the repo's test directory unless
pytest's `testpaths` already collects it, in which case the positional is omitted;
`{files}` stays only where the tests live under the scope's paths. Before, every python
scope got `{files}`, and on the ordinary pkg/ + tests/ layout `crapkit test-scoped pkg/x.py`
handed pytest a source file to collect from and exited 5. An npm workspace scope with a
test script gets `npm run test -w <dir>`, written live; a root JavaScript scope gets the
runner's related-tests mode keyed by what package.json names (`npx vitest related --run
{files}`, `npx jest --findRelatedTests {files}`) instead of a vitest command for every
language, and the placeholder when nothing names a runner; one comment line above each
entry names the form chosen. `init` also says when two workspaces name a runner and no js
lane was written. `doctor` re-runs `init`'s first-run note for every coverage.py lane, so a
lane whose python cannot import pytest-cov now fails doctor with the same sentence instead
of the first `crapkit coverage`; a healthy lane prints
`ok lane 'py': python -> <path> (pytest X, pytest-cov Y)`, with a WARN when that python is
not the one running doctor; a lane an environment manager heads (`uv run python -m pytest
--cov`) prints a `note` that its interpreter and pytest-cov were not probed, so a lane doctor
did not ask never reads as one it found healthy; and a `{files}` template on a scope that
holds no test file fails, naming the whole-suite form as the fix.

### One exclude glob reaches the repo root and every nested copy
A leading `**/` in an `[exclude]` glob matches zero or more directories, so `**/dist/**`
excludes a repo-root `dist/` as well as `web/dist/`, and `src/distro/` stays in. Under
fnmatch alone the prefix demanded a directory in front, which is why 0.4.12's "`init` and
`doctor` agree about the root and the dot-directories" wrote the root form beside every
nested form; that rationale is reversed here and the duplicates are gone. The default set
gains `**/generated/**`, `**/__generated__/**` and `**/*.generated.*`, so a generated
client is never the first `next-item`, and `crapkit init` writes the list one glob per
line under a two-line comment instead of a 405-character line. A hand-written root form
such as `dist/**` still matches the root and nothing below it. A committed config carrying
only `**/dist/**`, `**/conftest.py` or `**/*.test.*` now also excludes the root copy: run
`crapkit doctor` after upgrading and read the per-scope file counts.
### A failed lane's old artifact is refused on reuse
A lane that ran and did not rewrite its artifact was refused by `coverage` (exit 5) and then
scored by the next `coverage --reuse-artifacts` and passed by `verify --reuse-artifacts`,
which wrote the dead lane's old numbers in as the trusted baseline. The failed attempt now
records the modification time of the file it left behind in `.crapkit/artifacts.json`, and
reuse refuses the file while that time still matches: `lane 'py' wrote no artifact on its
last attempt — the .crapkit/cov/py.json on disk predates it and is the previous run's, which
--reuse-artifacts will not score`, exit 5 for `coverage` and `verify cannot conclude with
failed lanes` for `verify`. A real run or a rewrite of the file clears it, so a coverage JSON
combined by hand from a killed run's shards still reuses. A lane refused before it ran (the
container guard) records nothing, and `--reuse-unchanged` reruns a lane whose last attempt
wrote nothing instead of trusting its stamp commit. The 0.4.12 entry's "`--reuse-artifacts`
is untouched" no longer holds; see it below.

### The full-suite guard knows pytest's `testpaths`
`python -m pytest tests --cov=app` beside `testpaths = ["tests"]` collects the whole suite,
and the guard refused it (`positional argument 'tests' narrows a full-suite coverage run`,
exit 3) from every command that loads the configuration, and the advisory hook stayed silent
in that repo. The loader now takes the repository root, reads `testpaths` from the file
pytest would pick where the lane runs (`pytest.ini` and `.pytest.ini` decide when present,
even empty; `pyproject.toml`, `tox.ini` and `setup.cfg` when they hold a pytest section) and
accepts the positionals when together they name every configured entry. One entry of
several, or a positional the testpaths do not name, is refused as before, and a lane
without a positional reads no file. `doctor`, `coverage`, `digest`, `ratchet seed` and the
hook all load such a lane.
### Every worklist row carries its CRAP score and coverage
The ranking view of a CRAP scorer printed risk, ccn, the standard-only ccn, churn and the
recency weight, and never the score; the HTML report sent its reader to `crapkit explain`
per row. A row now reads `risk 14.0  ccn 14  crap 38.5  cov 50%  1c/1a  calc/grade.py:7
classify( ... )`: `(N std)` and `w 0.00` leave the text, and `--json` keeps `ccn_std` and
`weight` beside the new `crap` and `cov`, both `null` on an inventory-only run and each
row's own where two functions share a name in one file. The header counts the active rows
against their total, `50 of 3980 active (worklist_top 50)`, or `(--top N)` when the flag
set the cap, and `--json` carries `active_total`, so a capped list never reads as the whole
repo. The report page renders CRAP and Cov columns and drops the footer sentence that
claimed no payload carried them. The demo recording is re-rendered, and the demo generator
now folds the interpreter path `python -m crapkit` prints in its next steps back to
`crapkit` instead of refusing the frame.

### An unknown `--scope` is a configuration error
`worklist --scope frontend` on a repo whose scopes are `api` and `web` printed `0 active,
0 dormant` at exit 0, which a CI step reads as a clean pass, and `next-item --scope biling`
answered `empty: true` with every reason at 0, the payload an agent reads as a finished
scope. Both now exit 3 with `no scope named 'frontend'; declared: api, web` before the
store is opened, the same class the loader raises for a lane naming an undeclared scope.

### Worklist rows say which functions are accepted debt
Every `worklist --json` row carries `ratchet_mark`: the committed mark's value, or `null`
when the function carries no mark or the repo has no marks file. The mark is read under
the function's own ratchet key, counted over the whole run, so the second of two `f( )`
in one file reports the mark on `f( )#2` and never its twin's.

### A one-commit repository ranks by complexity
Every row on a fresh repo read `risk 0.0` with `weight 0.0` and `commits 1`, because a
log with one timestamp has no range to weight against and the recency logistic rounded
every commit to nothing. A commit in such a log now counts once, the same degrade an
untimestamped log already got, so the first worklist ranks by ccn times one; the hot
promotion is off when every file weighs the same, since a top 10% of equal weights would
be every file. Repositories with two or more commit times are unchanged.

### One ceiling rule, and a coverage summary that says what shape the run is

`Config.ceiling_of(scope)` is the one spelling of "a scope's own `target`, else the repo's"
for every command that holds a Config (`next-item`, `brief`'s packet, the hook's file ceilings,
the coverage summary, `digest`); the pure modules (score, verify, ratchet, packet, sarif,
worklist, store) keep taking the `(target, scope_targets)` pair. `digest` now counts each row against its
scope's ceiling like `trend` does, so the two agree on the same run pair: on the mini fixture
with `src` at 200 and `tangled` (crap 72) added under it, `digest` said `over target 0 -> 1`
and `new over target: src/extra.ts tangled` while `trend --json` read `[0, 0]`; it now says
`over ceiling 0 -> 0`. Its lines read `over ceiling A -> B` and `new over ceiling: ...`.
The coverage summary carries the run's shape on every path: `--json` gains `kind` (`coverage`
or `partial`), `unmeasured_scopes` and `ceilings` (`{"default": 6, "reports": 12}`) beside
`lane_failures`, and `over_target` and `grade` are counted over the measured scopes only, so a
`--lane web` run no longer books the other scope's no-lane functions as this run's debt
(`by_scope` still carries them). The plain form reads `run 1 @ fae4db93108: 2 functions
scored: 2 measured, 1 over ceiling 6, CRAP load 41.0, grade F` (zero buckets dropped, the
ceiling labelled, or `over their ceilings (6; reports 12, util 4)`), then `-> next: crapkit
worklist`; a partial run opens with `partial run (lane web; api unmeasured; not a baseline)`
and ends with `-> rerun changed lanes: crapkit coverage --reuse-unchanged`, which the `--lane`
help now names. The `report` page collects its worklist through the same shaping `worklist
--json` prints, so its rows carry `ratchet_mark`. Moved contracts: the coverage line in
tests/unit/test_cli_scoring_inproc.py and the docs regex in
tests/unit/test_docs_claims_contract.py; `new over target` in tests/e2e/test_inventory_e2e.py
and tests/unit/test_store_prune.py; `build_digest` takes `ceiling_of` (tests/unit/test_digest.py,
tests/unit/test_narrow_reads.py); every pasted summary line in README.md, docs/lanes.md and
docs/ratchet.md.

### `--json` prints one error object when a command dies

A crapkit error escaping a command under `--json` used to leave stdout empty: `coverage
--json` with pytest-cov missing exited 5 with 0 bytes, so the Action's comment read "wrote no
run summary" while the sentence naming the fix stayed in the job log. stdout now carries
`{"error": {"exit": 5, "kind": "tool", "message": "every lane failed (2 of 2); the errors are
above"}, "schema": 1}`, with `kind` one of `state` (exit 1), `config` (3), `git` (4) or `tool`
(5); the stderr line and the exit code are unchanged, and without `--json` stdout stays
empty. docs/agent-json.md gains an Errors section.

### `rescore --gate` carries its verdict, and a tenth MCP tool hands it to agents

`rescore --gate --json` adds a `gate` block: `ok`, `judged` (the functions the working tree
changed since HEAD, untracked files in full), `ceilings` per rescored file, `breaches` (path,
function, start, ccn, cov, crap, remedy, key_name, ceiling) and `untracked`; exit 6 on a
breach is unchanged. The text form prints `gate: 2 changed function(s) judged, 0 over ceiling
6` when the gate passes, so the exit code is no longer the only signal. A tenth MCP tool,
`gate`, maps `path` to `rescore PATH --gate --json` with the same read-only annotations; a
breach comes back as a result with `gate.ok` false and `structuredContent`, while exits 3, 4
and 5 stay tool errors. The server's instructions, AGENTS.md, both MCP tables and the registry
manifest (`server.json`) count ten tools.

### stdin is read as UTF-8 on Windows, so a non-ASCII path reaches the hook and the MCP server

On Windows a piped stdin arrived in the locale code page while Claude Code and MCP clients
write UTF-8, so the PostToolUse advisory for a ccn-8 edit in `pkg/café.py` exited 0 with no
output, and `brief` over MCP answered `no function named 'f' in pkg/cafÃ©.py ... it holds:
nothing`. crapkit now reconfigures a non-tty stdin to UTF-8 with replacement, the same rule
stdout and stderr already had; a tty keeps its native encoding. Under
`PYTHONIOENCODING=cp1252` the same payload now exits 2 with the advisory naming
`pkg/café.py`, and the MCP call answers the function.

### A configuration or marks file saved with a BOM reads as the same file; a UTF-16 one names the fix

PowerShell 5.1's `Out-File -Encoding utf8` writes a byte-order mark, which tomllib read as
`crapkit.toml does not parse: Invalid statement (at line 1, column 1)` and the marks reader
as `line 1 has 1 fields, expected 3` behind a `carries no metric stamp` warning; a bare
`Out-File` writes UTF-16, which died as a raw UnicodeDecodeError traceback at exit 1. One
reader, `crapkit.repotext`, now decodes crapkit.toml, the marks file and a portable baseline
with `utf-8-sig`, and a decode error is a configuration error, exit 3: `crapkit.toml is not
UTF-8 (first bytes ff fe = UTF-16, the PowerShell 5.1 Out-File default); save it as UTF-8`,
or `(byte e9 at offset 15)` when the mark is not the cause. Every configuration read
(`watch`, `doctor`'s raw pass and the advisory hook included), `ratchet seed`, `prune`,
`move`, `merge` (the git merge driver, which refused a BOM side as `ours is [unstamped]` and
died on a UTF-16 one), `explain`, `brief`, `rescore --gate`, `verify`'s stamp guard, its
marks compare, the marks read behind `--override` and `--baseline-tsv` go through it; no
second copy of the decode exists. `verify` and `ratchet merge` write a marks file they
rewrite without the mark.

### `doctor` warns on a hook file git cannot spawn

A pre-commit hook written with `Out-File` starts with a byte-order mark, git answers every
commit with `cannot spawn .git/hooks/pre-commit` and lets it through ungated, and `doctor`
passed the file. It now reads the hook git would run (`git rev-parse --git-path
hooks/pre-commit`, so `core.hooksPath` and a linked worktree are honored) and WARNs
`.git/hooks/pre-commit starts with a UTF-8 byte-order mark (ef bb bf), which git cannot
spawn; rewrite it as ASCII (PowerShell: Set-Content -Encoding ascii)`, naming `a UTF-16
byte-order mark (ff fe, the PowerShell 5.1 Out-File default)` for the other. The README's
Route 1 gains the PowerShell form, `Set-Content -Encoding ascii` with the interpreter quoted
and forward-slashed.

### The lines a shell captures are ASCII

`$x = crapkit worklist` under code page 437 captured `ΓÇö` where the header's em dash was.
The six one-liners a script reads back now use ` - `: the worklist header (`... churn 12mo)
- 1 of 3 active (worklist_top 50), 0 dormant`), `init`'s next step (`... own files: py -
next: run ...`), the `ratchet seed` and `prune` line (`... added 1, tightened 0 - 1 mark(s)
vs run 1 ...`), the `watch` banner (`watching 12 tracked files every 2.0s - ctrl-c to stop`),
with the coverage summary and the verify OK line ASCII already. The same move on the four
lines the earlier slices handed over: doctor's `cannot import pytest_cov - run ...` note, the
`(rebase or amend rewrote history) - run ...` refusal, the MCP `no crapkit.toml in <dir> -
nothing measured here.` result and the CLI's `no crapkit.toml at <dir> - nothing to analyze`
(the Action's base step quotes that line verbatim and needs no change). `trend`'s text line
says `N over ceiling` like `digest`. Moved contracts: the worklist header suffix in
tests/e2e/test_two_view_queue_e2e.py, the watch banner in tests/unit/test_watch_shell.py,
`over target` in tests/e2e/test_cli_report_gaps.py and the AGENTS.md `below_floor` row it
pins, and every README, AGENTS.md, docs/lanes.md, docs/ratchet.md, docs/agent-json.md and
plugin skill transcript that pastes one of those lines (docs/demo.svg is re-rendered at
release).

### Configuration is found upward, the way git finds `.git`

Every command read `crapkit.toml` from the working directory only, so from a monorepo
workspace `crapkit worklist` exited 3 with `no crapkit.toml at .../mono/web` while the root
configuration one level up claimed `web/`, and `crapkit init` there wrote a second
configuration claiming the same files. Without `--repo`, every command, `crapkit mcp` and
each MCP tool's `repo` argument now walk up from the working directory to the nearest
`crapkit.toml`, the way the advisory hook always did (ADR 0002); a `.git` entry without one
stops the walk, so a linked worktree or a nested repository never borrows a parent's
configuration or store. When the root found is not the working directory one stderr line
says `crapkit: using crapkit.toml at /repo`, and a relative path argument to `brief`,
`explain`, `rescore`, `test-scoped` or `mutate --files` is read from where you stand, so
`crapkit brief src/grade.ts classify` typed in `web/` names `web/src/grade.ts`; a path that
climbs out of the root is refused with `is outside the repo at /repo`. A given `--repo` names
an exact root and walks nowhere, on `mcp` as on every other subcommand, and reads a relative
path argument against that root as before; the flag now defaults to nothing rather than `.`.
The MCP server runs each tool's command at the root it found, so a tool's repo-relative
`path` holds from a server a global client started in a workspace, and a `repo` argument
naming no directory gets the no-config answer instead of an ancestor's data. `init` writes
where you stand and exits 3 with `crapkit.toml at /repo already claims web (scope 'web');
edit that configuration instead` when an ancestor's scope path claims the directory, and
writes no nested `.gitignore` line when a `.gitignore` above already ignores `.crapkit/`; a
nested repository, whose top git consults nothing above, still gets its own line. A stray
`crapkit.toml` in a non-git ancestor, such as a home directory, is adopted with that stderr
line as the only warning. Moved contracts: `--repo`'s default of
`.` (tests/unit/test_report_command.py), the lanes page's "no monorepo mode" sentence, the
README's two `--repo` default lines, the agents page's server line and AGENTS.md's default.

### Upgrading from 0.4.x

- **Run `crapkit doctor` first.** Three defaults changed under committed configs, and doctor
  names each one where it applies: an `[exclude]` glob with a leading `**/` now also matches the
  repo-root copy (`**/dist/**` excludes `dist/` too), so read the per-scope file counts; a
  coverage.py lane whose python cannot import pytest-cov now fails doctor instead of the first
  `crapkit coverage`; and a `{files}` scoped-test template on a scope that holds no test file
  fails, naming the whole-suite form as the fix.
- **The first `inventory` or `coverage` runs the analysis cache cold.** The analysis version is 9:
  a Python function's `nesting` is now a depth (a flat chain of seven `if`s reads 1, not 7), and
  the cognitive pass no longer charges the first token after a nested helper to that helper. `ccn`
  does not move, so no ratchet mark moves; six of crapkit's own 5,258 rows shift `cognitive` by one.
- **`worklist` text rows changed shape.** `(N std)` and `w 0.00` left the line; `crap` and `cov` joined
  it, and the header reads `50 of 3980 active (worklist_top 50)`. A script that parsed the text
  should read `worklist --json`, which keeps `ccn_std` and `weight` and adds `crap`, `cov`,
  `ratchet_mark` and `active_total` (schema stays 1).
- **The coverage summary line changed shape.** It reads `run 1 @ <sha>: N functions scored:
  N measured, 1 over ceiling 6, CRAP load 41.0, grade F`, drops zero buckets, and a partial run
  opens with `partial run (...)`; `over_target` and `grade` on a partial run count the measured
  scopes only. `digest` says `over ceiling`, and so does `trend`.
- **Under `--json`, a command that dies prints one error object on stdout** (`{"error": {"exit",
  "kind", "message"}, "schema": 1}`) instead of nothing; stderr and the exit code are unchanged.
  Over MCP the same object is the tool's `isError` text for the `--json` tools.
- **An unknown `--scope` exits 3** (`no scope named 'x'; declared: api, web`) where it printed an
  empty list at exit 0.
- **`--reuse-artifacts` refuses the artifact of a lane whose last attempt wrote nothing** (exit 5
  for `coverage`, `cannot conclude` for `verify`). A real run or a rewrite of the file clears it.
- **A lane positional that names pytest's `testpaths` now loads.** `python -m pytest tests --cov`
  beside `testpaths = ["tests"]` was refused at exit 3 from every command; it is accepted when the
  positionals together name every configured entry. `init` omits the positional in that case.
- **`mutate` never places a mutant in a test file**, and a scope declaring `paths = ["."]` selects
  no file for `mutate`, as it already selected none for scoring: declare the files by name.
- **The Action fails a pull request it could not judge.** With `gate: "true"`, a base run that was
  attempted and not made (a depth-1 checkout, no `crapkit.toml` at the fork point, a lane failing
  there) exits 1 and the comment says why; set `fetch-depth: 0` on `actions/checkout`. A failed
  `coverage` now skips `verify` and exits with coverage's code. The comment's verdict names the
  rule and lists one bullet per finding.
- **`verify` touches `crapkit-ratchet.tsv` only when something moved**, never creates it empty, and
  its OK line says what it wrote (`ratchet: 6 dropped, 1 tightened -> git add crapkit-ratchet.tsv`).
  A refused `--override` now prints one stderr line naming the cause.
- **A one-commit repository ranks by complexity** instead of reading `risk 0.0` on every row.
- **The MCP server has ten tools.** `gate` maps a path to `rescore PATH --gate --json`; `explain`
  and `doctor` answer JSON; `worklist` and `next_item` take `scope`; a bad call answers `isError`
  instead of ending the session.
- **Windows reads and prints plainly.** stdin is read as UTF-8 even when it is a pipe, so the hook
  and the MCP server no longer see mojibake; a `crapkit.toml` or marks file saved as UTF-16 (the
  PowerShell 5.1 `Out-File` default) exits 3 with `crapkit.toml is not UTF-8 (first bytes ff fe =
  UTF-16 ...); save it as UTF-8` where it was a traceback, and a UTF-8 BOM on either file is
  tolerated; `doctor` WARNs on a pre-commit hook that starts with a BOM, which git cannot spawn.
  The six shell-captured one-liners (the worklist header, the ratchet seed line, the coverage
  `next` line, the watch line and two more) use ` - ` where they used an em dash, so a script
  matching them by that character must change; `trend` and `brief` text say `over ceiling`.
- **Every command finds `crapkit.toml` by walking up.** `--repo` now defaults to the walk instead of
  `.`: a command run below a root uses the nearest configuration above it and prints
  `crapkit: using crapkit.toml at <root>` on stderr (stdout is untouched, `--json` stays one
  object); a `.git` entry holding no configuration stops the walk, so a linked worktree or a nested
  repository never borrows a parent's store; an explicit `--repo` names an exact root and walks
  nowhere, so the Action and every script that passes it are unchanged. When the walk found the
  root, a relative path argument names the file where the user stands, and one climbing out of
  the root exits 3; under an explicit `--repo` the argument stays root-relative as before. `init` exits 3 under a directory an ancestor configuration already claims through a
  scope path, and skips its `.gitignore` append when an ancestor `.gitignore` up to the repository
  top already ignores `.crapkit/`. A stray `crapkit.toml` in a non-git ancestor, a home directory
  say, is adopted with that stderr line as the only warning (ADR 0002). Run `crapkit doctor` from
  the directory you work in and read the root it names.

## 0.4.15 — 2026-09-02

### The registry name follows GitHub's casing

The MCP Registry grants each GitHub user the namespace spelled the way GitHub spells the login, so the server is `io.github.JeanFrancoisGagne/crapkit` in `server.json`, in the README ownership marker and in the contract that pins the two together. The lowercase form was refused with a 403 at publish time.

## 0.4.14 — 2026-09-01

### The MCP Registry can verify and list this server
`server.json` at the repository root describes the server the way the official MCP
Registry (registry.modelcontextprotocol.io) reads it: the PyPI package, the stdio
transport, and the `mcp` subcommand a client passes to it. The README carries the
`mcp-name:` ownership marker the registry checks against the package's own description,
which is why the marker ships in a release rather than living only on GitHub. A contract
holds both version fields in the manifest to `crapkit.__version__`, so a release bump
cannot leave the registry pointing at last release's package.

### A comparison page for the reader who already runs a neighbour
`docs/comparison.md` says what radon, xenon, wily, coverage.py and SonarQube each
measure and gate, where crapkit's complexity-times-uncovered join sits next to them, and
that nothing conflicts: crapkit reads the same coverage artifact the suite already
writes. The README's deep-reference table links it.

## 0.4.13 — 2026-09-01

### The MCP handshake speaks the client's protocol revision
The server answered every `initialize` with `2024-11-05`, the protocol's first revision,
which told a current client to drop everything newer. The handshake now echoes the
client's revision when the server implements it (`2025-06-18`, `2025-03-26` or
`2024-11-05`) and offers `2025-06-18` otherwise. A tool whose text is a JSON object now
also carries it parsed as `structuredContent`, which is how a client on the current
revision reads machine output; prose, arrays and error text stay text-only.

### Every MCP tool says when to reach for it and what each argument means
The nine tool descriptions were one-line noun phrases, several arguments carried a bare
type with no description, and nothing in the listing said the tools were read-only. Every
description is now two sentences (what it answers, then when to use it or how it relates
to its neighbour), every argument names its meaning and default, every tool declares
`readOnlyHint`/`idempotentHint`/`openWorldHint` annotations, and `initialize` returns
`instructions` carrying the two-command prerequisite a connected model otherwise learns
from nine identical error results.

## 0.4.12 — 2026-09-01

### A lane that writes nothing no longer scores the previous run's artifact
crapkit asked only whether the artifact file existed, never whether the run that just
finished wrote it. So a lane failed loud exactly once, on the first run against an empty
`.crapkit/`, and went quietly wrong on every run after: the suite dies in collection, last
run's coverage JSON is still sitting there, and crapkit scores it as fresh, stamps it with
the current commit and hands `--reuse-unchanged` a reason to keep trusting it. A vitest
lane without `reportOnFailure` and a pytest lane hitting a collection error both land here.
A lane now records the modification time of every file it declares before each attempt and
requires it to move, so the refusal fires on the second run the way it did on the first. A
leftover file gets its own wording — `wrote no artifact this run — the .crapkit/cov/py.json
on disk predates it and is the previous run's` — because the old sentence, about a path
that holds a report, reads as crapkit failing to see the file. Where the artifact is missing
and the leftover is some other declared file, the artifact path still leads: `produced no
artifact at .crapkit/cov/py.json, and the .crapkit/cov/junit.xml on disk is the previous
run's`. `results_artifact` is held to
the same rule, so a killed suite's junit cannot feed the test-count and no-new-failures
checks last run's numbers. The check is the mtime and not the bytes, so a runner that
rewrites an identical report stays green. `--reuse-artifacts` was left untouched by this
release; 0.5.0 makes it refuse the same leftover.

### `mutate` refuses to score a suite that never ran
`crapkit mutate` read any nonzero exit from `mutation_command` as a killed mutant, so a
command that cannot run here killed all of them and printed a 100% mutation score for a
suite that never imported the code under test. The documented command is
`python -m pytest -q -x`, a bare name, so any machine whose PATH `python` is not the
interpreter holding pytest — a hook, a cron, cmd.exe, the Windows Store stub that exits
9009 — got a perfect score. The command now runs once against the unmutated tree before
the first mutant, in the worker's own checkout when the run is parallel. A baseline that
does not exit 0 ends the command (exit 5) naming the runner word, its exit code and the
score it would otherwise have printed, instead of scoring anything.

### A scope path spelled `./src` claims the files under `src`
`paths = ["./src"]` claimed nothing. The declared string is hoisted straight into a
match prefix, so the matcher looked for `./src/...` while `git ls-files` emits
`src/a.py`: the scope scored zero files, every file under it became unclaimed, and
`doctor` printed two FAILs that named neither the dot — it blamed the empty scope, then
blamed the file for having no scope, which sends the reader to declare a second scope
for a path the first one already owned. Outside `doctor` it was quieter still:
`crapkit inventory` reported `0 functions in 0 files` and exited 0. Backslashes were
already collapsed one layer down, which made the tool look like it normalized paths.
Scope paths are now normalized where they are parsed: a leading `./`, a leading or
trailing `/`, and `\` as a separator. A path holding `..` or a drive letter is a config
error naming the scope, because no tracked file can ever match it.

### `duplication --top 0` no longer prints a clean bill of health
`crapkit duplication --top 0` printed "no near-duplicate functions found" and exited 0
over a tree full of duplicate pairs, which is a false all-clear and the thing a CI job
reads. `--top -1` sliced from the tail and dropped the last pair with nothing said.
`coupling --top` sat behind the same unguarded slice. Both commands now refuse anything
below 1 at the entry, before they open the store: `duplication --top must be >= 1, got
0`, exit 3.

### `next-item --top 0` refuses instead of handing out an item
`crapkit next-item --top 0` printed an item and, with `--claim`, took a claim on it that
hid that function from every other session. `--top -1` did the same. The slice was
written `ranked[:max(top, 1)]`, so a 0 widened back to one, and the emit branch tested
`top > 1`, so anything below it fell through to the single-item shape. An agent
templating `--top {budget}` that computed 0 got work it had not asked for, locked. Its
sibling `crapkit worklist --top 0` already exited 3 naming the rule. `next-item` now
answers the same way: `next-item --top must be >= 1, got 0`, exit 3, no claim taken.

### One unimportable test file no longer takes the whole pytest lane down
A repo with a renamed module, a missing optional extra or a stale editable install got
`coverage exit=5` and `every lane failed (1 of 1)` from a suite whose other test files
collected fine. pytest raises `Interrupted` at the end of collection when any module
fails to import, so pytest-cov's session finish never runs and the lane writes no
coverage JSON at all; the junit lands anyway, which makes the run read as half finished
rather than as a flag. `doctor` said "no problems found". The lane `init` writes now
carries `--continue-on-collection-errors`, and so does the commented template beside it,
which is pytest's half of the `--coverage.reportOnFailure` the vitest lane already got.
Nothing is hidden: the uncollected file's tests stay in the junit as errors. The vitest
and jest lanes are untouched.

### The vitest lane still writes coverage when a test fails
vitest writes no coverage report at all on a failed run, so a repo with one red test got
exit 5 naming a missing `coverage-final.json`: a message about a file, for a run that was
really about a flag. The junit report landed anyway, which made the run look half
finished. The scaffolded vitest lane now carries `--coverage.reportOnFailure`, in the live
lane and in the commented template alike. jest gets no such flag: it reports on a red run
already, and exits on a flag it does not know. Setting `reportOnFailure: true` in your
vitest config is still the other way to spell it; `init` writes the flag because it must
not edit your vitest config to write a lane.

### A coverage.py report without branch data scores instead of failing the lane
`pytest --cov --cov-report=json` without `--cov-branch` is the default shape of an existing
CI artifact, and it failed the whole lane: nothing scored, exit 5, on a report holding
per-function statement counts crapkit's own model already knows how to divide. Every
function falls back to statement coverage when it holds no branches, and that fallback runs
on every normal report, so the guard was blocking arithmetic crapkit performs all day. It
is now one stderr warning naming the lane and saying the coverage term is statement-based
for this artifact. A report carrying neither branch nor statement data is still refused,
because there is nothing to divide by and every function in it would score fully covered.

### One file with no function regions no longer throws the whole report away
coverage.py writes the per-file `functions` key once per code-region kind that file's own
reporter declares, so a file measured by a plugin reporter declaring none — django or jinja
template coverage — loses the key while every `.py` file in the same report keeps it. That
single entry failed the lane, the run scored nothing, and the files that were fine were
never mentioned. Those files are now skipped and named in one warning, and the rest of the
report is scored. A report where NO file carries regions is still exit 5, which is the
"coverage is too old" case the message was written for. Both readers weigh that verdict
before the branch-data one, so `pytest --cov --cov-report=json` on a coverage below 7.6 —
missing regions and branch data at once — is told which version it needs instead of being
sent to add `--cov-branch`, which would change nothing.

### `--reuse-artifacts` no longer refuses a salvaged coverage run
A killed suite leaves a good coverage JSON only if you combine its shards by hand, and
the junit beside it is the killed run's own: empty, or missing. Reading that report was
a hard exit 5, so the only way through was deleting `results_artifact` from the config,
which gives up the crashed-worker and no-new-failures checks on every future run instead
of on this one. Under `--reuse-artifacts` an unreadable junit is now one warning naming
the file and what cannot be checked, and the lane scores off the coverage JSON. The lane
lands on the no-counts path `verify` already reports. Nothing changed for a lane that
actually ran: a report that says the run did not finish still fails it, which is the
whole point of the check.

### A lane that produced no artifact says whether its coverage shards survived
`coverage run --parallel-mode`, which pytest-xdist turns on, writes one `.coverage.*` per
process and combines them only at the end. A killed run therefore leaves every measurement
it took on disk and no JSON, one directory above the artifact path the refusal names, and
the refusal never mentioned them: one reporter found them on their own and combined them
by hand. The message now counts the shards, says which directory holds them, and gives the
two commands that turn them into a scored run (`coverage combine && coverage json -o
<artifact>`, then `--reuse-artifacts`), with the `-o` target written relative to that
directory so a lane with a `cwd` writes the JSON where crapkit reads it. Only a
`coveragepy` lane gets the recipe. crapkit does not combine them itself: shards from
an interrupted suite merge into a report that looks like a whole run, which is what the
crashed-worker check exists to refuse.

### New lane key `no_progress_seconds` kills a suite that stops making progress
`timeout_seconds` has to be longer than your slowest honest run, so it cannot cut a suite
that hangs at minute three without cutting the slow ones too, and its default is no
deadline at all: a lane that hung sat at 0% CPU with crapkit waiting on it and nothing
watching the log. `no_progress_seconds` watches the log instead. crapkit polls while the
lane runs and kills the whole process tree when the log has not grown for that many
seconds, then says so in words a stall earns: `lane 'py' wrote no output for 300s (attempt
1), so crapkit killed it`, with `[crapkit] no output for 300s; killed` at the end of the
log. `retries` covers it the way it covers a timeout. Default `0`, no watch.

### `init` writes the venv the repo carries, not the python the shell answers with
A library whose own `.venv` holds pytest and pytest-cov, on a machine whose PATH `python`
holds neither, got a lane reading `python -m pytest --cov`. `init` exited 0, `doctor`
called that config clean, and the first `crapkit coverage` exited 5 with `No module named
pytest` while the right interpreter sat in the tree the whole time. With no lockfile to
pin the environment, `init` now looks for one: `.venv`, `venv`, and a `.venv` inside each
scope it just sniffed. A directory counts only when it holds `pyvenv.cfg` and its
interpreter imports pytest, so an empty environment and a `venv/` package of sources both
leave the bare name alone, and a lockfile still wins outright. The lane and the
`[crapkit.scoped_tests]` entry get the same repo-relative launcher, `.venv/bin/python` or
`.venv\\Scripts\\python.exe` in the file on Windows, which is the TOML escape for the
one path cmd.exe can start: an unquoted `.venv/Scripts/python` answers `'.venv' is not
recognized`.

### `doctor` reads a lane's runner from the directory the lane runs in
A lane naming the launcher above passed `doctor` inside the repo and failed it from
anywhere else: the check resolved the first word against the directory `doctor` was
started in, not the one the lane runs in. So `crapkit doctor --repo <path>` reported
`FAIL lane 'py': executable '.venv\\Scripts\\python.exe' does not resolve on PATH` against
the config `crapkit init` had just written, and the MCP `doctor` tool, which spawns that
command with no directory of its own, said it about every repo but its own. A first word
carrying a separator is now looked for under the lane's `cwd`, the way a named script
already was; a bare name is still PATH's question.

### `doctor` reads a lane's runner on the PATH the lane runs with
The other half of the same check: a bare first word. `lanes.py` starts a lane with
`{**os.environ, **lane.env}`, so a lane that ships its own toolchain through
`[lane.env] PATH` runs a runner crapkit's own process cannot see. The check asked
`which()` with the process environment, so such a lane came back
`FAIL lane 'be': executable 'suite.bat' does not resolve on PATH` and `doctor` exited 1 on a
lane that works. The lane's `cwd` had just been threaded through this check; its env was not.
A bare first word is now looked for on the lane's own PATH when it declares one, and on the
process PATH when it does not.

### `crapkit init`'s missing-pytest-cov note names which python it asked
The note said "this python cannot import pytest_cov" and named no interpreter. A machine
has more than one, and the repo above has two: the note fired for the PATH `python` while
the venv beside it already carried the plugin, so the printed fix (install a package) was
the wrong move for that tree. The note now names the word the lane runs, the path that
word resolves to here, and an install bound to it (`python -m pip install pytest-cov`),
so the reader can tell whether to install anything or repoint the lane.

### The lane-failure hint from `crapkit coverage` names the environment the package has to land in
When a lane failed because pytest rejected `--cov`, the hint read `pip install pytest-cov`
and named no environment at all. The package has to land in the interpreter the LANE runs,
and a repo whose lane points at its own venv gets a line that resolves to whatever venv the
shell has active: one reporter ran it verbatim, pip reported success, and the next
`crapkit coverage` failed identically. The hint now names the environment the suite runs in,
and binds the install to an interpreter under the condition `crapkit init` uses: the lane
starts with the word that runs pytest, and that word is a python. So `python -m pytest --cov`
gets `python -m pip install pytest-cov`, while `uv run pytest --cov` and `coverage run -m
pytest` get the environment named and no command — neither `uv` nor `coverage` has a `-m pip
install`, and running one costs the reader a second, unrelated failure. The word is read with
the shell that runs the command, so a quoted interpreter path stays one word instead of
breaking at its space.
`init`'s own note, above, is the other half.

### The full-suite refusal names the fix for a suite that cannot collect itself
A repo whose `pytest.ini` names four testpaths, and whose whole-suite run dies during
collection because a shared `conftest.py` is registered twice under
`--import-mode=importlib`, has no full-suite pytest command to write. The lane `init`
wrote failed, the one command that collected (`pytest conform`) was refused for
narrowing a full-suite run, and the only exit the refusal named was `full_suite =
false` on that one lane: it clears the refusal, exits 0 everywhere, and silently leaves
the other three testpaths unmeasured.

The refusal now names the second exit, one lane per testpath with `full_suite = false`
and its own artifact, and `docs/lanes.md` shows the block. `crapkit init` writes it for
you: when the repo's pytest config names more than one testpath (`pytest.ini`,
`setup.cfg` or `[tool.pytest.ini_options]`, read in pytest's own order), the starter
config carries the detected lane plus one commented sibling lane per testpath, each
with its own artifact and junit report. Detection still reads files only; nothing is
run and nothing is imported.

### `init` puts the js lane in the workspace that owns the runner
In a monorepo the root `package.json` names no test runner: its `test` script only chains
the workspaces, and vitest lives in `web/` with the only `package.json` that lists it.
`init` read the root and nothing else, so it wrote `npm run test -- --coverage` with no
coverage directory, no junit report and no `cwd`. `doctor` then WARNed twice about the
config `init` had just written, and the lane could not produce the artifact it was asked
for. `init` now reads every tracked `package.json` outside `node_modules`. When the root
names no runner and exactly one workspace does, the lane runs there: `cwd` is that
directory, and every path in the command climbs back to the repo root
(`--coverage.reportsDirectory=../.crapkit/cov/js`), while `artifact` stays root-relative
because crapkit resolves it from the root. Two workspaces naming a runner is a question
file presence cannot answer, so that case keeps the root lane it always got, and a root
that names a runner itself is untouched.

### `init` and `doctor` agree about the root and the dot-directories
`doctor` failed on files `init` itself had walked past: `.github/workflows/gen.py`,
`.cursor/skills/skill.py`, a root `conftest.py`, a vendored tree. Two halves of one gap.
Dot-directories now leave the corpus unconditionally, the way test directories already do,
which repairs configs that are already committed and not only the ones `init` writes next;
a dot *file* stays in. And the default excludes carry the root form beside every nested
form, because a glob is whole-path and `**/vendor/**` needs a directory before `vendor`:
`vendor/**`, `dist/**`, `build/**`, `node_modules/**`, `conftest.py`, `test_*.py`,
`*_test.py`, `*.test.*`, `*.spec.*` and `*_test.go` join the set. A repo-root `vendor/`
therefore stops becoming a scope of its own, which `doctor` then failed as a scope no lane
measures, and which silently joined the js lane in a repo that had one, scoring vendored
code as the team's own debt. Production code at the root, `build.sh` and `tool.js`, still
FAILs: it is unmeasured source, and a scope may name a file.

### `doctor --plugin-root` checks the crapkit the hook will actually spawn
The one command written to check a plugin against, in `plugin.json`'s own words, the CLI it
will call, compared the manifest against the `__version__` of the module it was running in.
`plugin/hooks/hooks.json` names a bare `crapkit` on every PostToolUse entry and
`plugin/.mcp.json` names it for the MCP server, so the CLI the plugin starts is PATH's
answer. Two ways that lied. Run from a venv holding this version beside an older pipx
`crapkit`, it called the two sides equal while the hook spawned the older one. Run from a
project `.venv` with no `crapkit` on PATH at all — a plain `pip install` into the project,
the usual case — it printed nothing and exited 0 while every edit fired a command that
cannot start and the MCP server never came up. The check now resolves `crapkit` on PATH,
compares the manifest against that executable's own `--version`, and names the executable in
the line. No `crapkit` on PATH is a FAIL naming both files that spawn it.

### A repo path handed to crapkit says where the repo goes
`crapkit ~/some-repo` and `crapkit ./mini` read as "score this repo", and argparse
answered both with the invalid-choice dump of every subcommand name, none of which
was the route the reader wanted: the repo is a flag, `--repo`, on a subcommand. The
word repo never appeared in the output. A first argument shaped like a path (a
separator, a `~` prefix, `.` or `..`) now gets one line naming `crapkit inventory
--repo <path>` and `crapkit --help`. It is still exit 2, because it was exit 2 before,
and shape is the only trigger: a directory named `inventory` in the cwd cannot hijack
the subcommand, and a plain typo like `inventry` still gets argparse's usage dump.

### `crapkit help` answers the way git, npm and docker do
`crapkit help`, the habit git, npm and docker all answer to, fell into the same
invalid-choice branch as a typo: exit 2 and a brace dump of 25 subcommand names, which
never says that `--help` is the way to any one of them. `crapkit help` now prints the
command list and `crapkit help coverage` prints that subcommand's own help, both exit 0.
A TOPIC naming no subcommand exits 3 and says so.

### `crapkit ratchet` no longer demands a file no action wants
Bare `crapkit ratchet` exited 2 with "the following arguments are required: action,
FILE". FILE is not required: `ratchet report`, `ratchet seed` and `ratchet prune` all run
with no file and exit 0. argparse calls a `nargs="*"` positional required when it carries
no default, so the message sent the reader hunting for an argument three of the five
actions refuse to use. The positional now defaults to the empty list, and `cmd_ratchet`
keeps the per-action arity check that already told `merge` it wants three paths and
`move` two.

### One spelling for a file argument, `./` and absolute included
`crapkit test-scoped ./src/a.py` answered `./src/a.py belongs to no declared scope`,
which was false: the scope declaring it is in the same crapkit.toml that `src/a.py` and
its backslash spelling both route through. Worse, `crapkit rescore --gate` handed an absolute path
scored nothing and exited 0, a gate PASS on the same over-ceiling function that exits 6
spelled relative, which is what a wrapper or an agent hands crapkit when it already holds
the full path. Three commands each collapsed backslashes and did nothing else, so
`owning_scope`, which matches on a prefix, saw a path sharing none. `test-scoped`,
`rescore` and `mutate --files` now put every argument through one normalizer: backslashes
collapse, a `./` prefix goes, and an absolute path is resolved against the repo root. A
path that resolves outside the root is refused with `is outside the repo at <root>`
rather than matched against nothing.

### `report --out` writes to an absolute path
`crapkit report --out /somewhere/else/r.html` was refused with "report --out stays
inside <repo>", and on Windows no repo-relative spelling reaches another drive at all,
so the page could only be moved by copying it afterwards. The guard's own docstring
justified itself by pointing at `--export` and `--sarif`, which enforce nothing. An
absolute `--out` now writes where you pointed it and prints that path. A relative
`--out` that climbs out of the tree is still refused, and the refusal now says that
an absolute path is the way to write outside the repo.

### `--export`, `--sarif` and `--emit-baseline` create the directory they write into
`crapkit inventory --export out/new/inv.tsv` raised a Python traceback,
`FileNotFoundError`, and exit 1, a code crapkit's exit table does not define, when
`out/new/` did not exist yet. `report --out` created it. For `coverage --sarif` the crash
landed after the run was already committed to the store, so a run that had succeeded read
as an unrecoverable failure; `verify --emit-baseline` crashed after the lanes had run.
All three flags now go through the same rule `report --out` follows: the parent directory
is created, a relative path stays repo-relative and is refused when it climbs out of the
tree, and an absolute path writes where you named it. `report --out` reads that rule from
the same helper, so the four writers cannot drift apart again.

### The container guard fires where a suite launches, not where one is read
Inside a container, a `coveragepy` lane was refused even under `--reuse-artifacts`, where
crapkit runs no suite at all: the guard sat one line above the branch that decides whether
to launch anything. The message it printed — the python suite is host-only, container runs
OOM — described something the lane was not about to do, and the OOM it names cannot happen
while parsing a file that is already on disk. crapkit ships a Dockerfile and its own action
runs `crapkit verify --json --reuse-artifacts`, so reading host-built artifacts in a
container is a shape users reach for. The guard now sits on the launch path, and
`container_ok` still governs a lane that really runs.

### Every next step and refusal names the crapkit that is running
`init` closed with "next: run `crapkit coverage`", and every refusal behind it prescribed
the same bare name. That name is the console script, and two documented ways of running
crapkit put no such name on PATH: `python -m crapkit` from a source checkout, which the
README prints, and `exec <venv>/Scripts/python -m crapkit hook-precommit` from a git hook,
spelled that way because git runs hooks outside the activated venv. A reader in either one
copied the line the program had just printed and their shell exited 127. The process
already knew: `sys.argv[0]` is the console script when that started it and the package's
`__main__.py` when `python -m` did. 32 messages now read it: 28 across nine of the ten CLI
families (`claude-hook` prints none), the MCP server's unmeasured-directory result, the
ratchet's metric-version refusal, the stale-lane note and `report`'s row-cap refusal. The
line says `crapkit coverage` under the console script and `<the interpreter running this
process> -m crapkit coverage` otherwise, quoted when that path holds a space
(`C:\Program Files\…` reaches cmd.exe as three arguments unquoted). `sys.executable`,
never a bare `python`: on Windows that resolves to the WindowsApps stub, a venv holding no
crapkit, or the base interpreter a venv wraps. Eleven strings keep the console-script
spelling on purpose, because something other than the printing process reads them: the
brief packet's `commands.gate`, `commands.verify` and `commands.refresh`
(docs/agent-json.md pins them), the two crapkit.toml template comments `init` writes into
a consumer's repo, the `--claim` help text, the `doctor` WARN about a scope with no
`[crapkit.scoped_tests]` entry, the hook's stderr note about marked functions, and the
three commands the HTML report embeds (two `crapkit coverage`, one
`crapkit explain PATH NAME`), because the page travels to readers on other machines.

### A bad line in the ratchet file no longer costs the whole answer
A hand-edited `crapkit-ratchet.tsv` with one two-field line made `crapkit explain` and
`crapkit brief` die on an unhandled `ValueError` with a Python stack trace, and made
`rescore --gate` answer 1 with that trace instead of its own exit code. A three-field
line whose mark is empty or is not a number — the trailing tab a hand edit leaves — did
the same. Both explain and brief are also MCP tools, so an agent got the traceback. The
mark is one optional field of what those commands answer; the trajectory, the source, the
dark lines and the churn were all available. The read-only callers now skip either shape
and name it on stderr, which can only take a ceiling away from a gate, never raise one.
Every caller
that REWRITES the file keeps the strict refusal, the merge driver included, because a
skipped line there would delete a mark the repo signed for, and that refusal now arrives
as `unreadable ratchet file <name>` rather than a stack trace.

### The override receipt is spelled for the shell you are in
`hook-precommit` granted an override and printed `unset CRAPKIT_OVERRIDE_REASON`.
`unset` is a POSIX builtin: on Windows PowerShell answered
`CommandNotFoundException`, the variable stayed set, and the next commit was granted a
full override for a brand new violating function with nobody typing a reason. The
receipt now names `$env:CRAPKIT_OVERRIDE_REASON = $null` and `set
CRAPKIT_OVERRIDE_REASON=` on Windows and keeps `unset` everywhere else, and it adds the
line it was missing: a variable a CI job or a launcher exported is cleared where it was
set, not by any command in this shell.

### The Pester exclude example matches a test file at the repo root
docs/configuration.md told PowerShell users that `globs = ["**/*.Tests.ps1"]` excludes
their Pester suite. Globs match the whole path, so that pattern needs a directory in
front of the file name and never claims a repo-root `Deploy.Tests.ps1` — and PowerShell
repos keep scripts at the root more than most. The file stayed in the corpus, `doctor`
FAILed it as a tracked file no scope claims, and the FAIL pointed the reader back at the
page that gave the glob. The example now ships both forms with the reason, the way the
`**/dist/**` advice on the same page already does.

## 0.4.11 — 2026-09-01

### Every README and handbook link is absolute
PyPI publishes the README verbatim as the long description, so its 36 repo-relative
links (`docs/lanes.md`, `LICENSE`, `action.yml`, ...) resolved against pypi.org and
answered nothing there. The handbook linked its five deep-reference pages as bare
`lanes.md`, which GitHub Pages serves as text/markdown, so the browser downloaded a
file where the reader expected a page. Both now link out by full URL, the README's
handbook link opens the rendered page on the project site, and two contracts hold
the relative form out.

### The README pins `uses:` to the release it documents
The Action snippets in the README still said `@v0.4.8` two releases later: the release
bump touched `crapkit X.Y.Z` and `rev: vX.Y.Z` and nothing else, and no test read the
third pin. A contract now holds every `uses:` pin in the README to `crapkit.__version__`,
so a bump that forgets it fails before the tag.

### The 60-second start says when `init` writes a lane and when it writes a template
The comment on the `crapkit init` line promised "scopes, a coverage lane, .gitignore
lines" with no condition attached, so a reader whose repo carries neither a pytest marker
file nor a JS test setup expected a lane, got a commented template, and ran `crapkit
coverage` into a config that measures nothing. The line now names what `init` recognizes
(`pyproject.toml`, `pytest.ini` or `setup.cfg` for pytest; a test script or vitest/jest in
`package.json` for the JS side) and what happens without one: the lane comes commented
out, `init` says to declare one, and `docs/lanes.md` is how to fill it in.

### The formula says who coined the metric
The README printed `CRAP = ccn^2 * (1 - cov)^3 + ccn` with nothing under it about where
the score came from, which reads as if crapkit invented it. C.R.A.P., Change Risk
Anti-Patterns, was coined for crap4j by Alberto Savoia and Bob Evans in 2007, and the
handbook has said so from its first draft. The README now carries the same credit
directly under the formula, and a contract holds the four names in the paragraph that
formula sits in.

### The sample worklist explains its own `risk 0.0`
The 60-second start prints a worklist row scoring `risk 0.0`, which a first-time reader
takes as a broken ranking rather than as arithmetic. Churn weight is position in the
commit log, so a one-commit repo weights every file the same and the ranking falls back to
ccn order. The sample now says that in a clause and points at the Risk section, which has
carried the full explanation all along.

### The Action's whole-job snippet sets an interpreter up before installing into it
The snippet showed `pip install -e ".[dev]"` as the step before the action, with no
`actions/setup-python` in front of it. The action's own first step is
`actions/setup-python`, so a team copying that job installed their dependencies into
whatever interpreter the runner defaulted to and the lanes then ran on a different one:
the packages are on the machine and the lane still cannot import them. The snippet now
mirrors this repo's own dogfood job, `actions/setup-python@v5` with `python-version:
"3.12"` ahead of the install, and the `python-version` row of the inputs table says to
match the two. A contract holds the order in the snippet.

### The plugin section says which skills Claude reaches on its own
The section listed three skills as one set, so a reader waited for Claude to pick up
`crapkit-onboard` and it never did. `plugin/skills/crapkit-onboard/SKILL.md` carries
`disable-model-invocation: true`: wiring a repo up happens once, and its description has
no business in every turn's window. The section now splits them: `crapkit` and
`crapkit-recover` are the two Claude reaches by itself, and the third is
`/crapkit:crapkit-onboard`, which you type.

### The Install section says nothing leaves the machine
Nothing on the page told a reader evaluating crapkit for a private repo where their source
goes. It goes nowhere: scoring runs the reader's own test command locally and reads the
artifact it writes, and `src/crapkit` makes no network call of any kind. The Install
section now says so and links `SECURITY.md`, which has carried the same claim under
"It never phones home".
### A fork's read-only token no longer fails the whole action
A pull request from a fork carries a read-only token, so the `gh api` call that posts
the comment came back 403. Composite `run` steps use bash's `-e`, and that 403 failed
the step and the job: the check went red on a pull request whose scoring had all
passed, and the verdict the steps above computed was never explained anywhere. The step
now opens `code=0` and records what each `gh api` call got, the way the scoring steps
above it already did, and closes with a line naming the exit code and, when it is not
zero, the token as the likely cause. The comment lookup keeps a status of its own, so a
lookup that died on a closed pipe cannot blame the token for a comment that posted. No
step but the gate's now exits on a status it chose, and a contract test holds it there.
### A run with no surviving lane prints each failure once
`coverage` printed every failed lane's refusal and then raised
`every lane failed: <the same texts, joined>`, which the CLI printed again. On the
screen most first-time users meet, a vitest lane with no coverage provider installed,
that was one eight-line block twice over, with the same absolute paths in both copies,
and nothing in the second copy that was not in the first. The closing line is now a
count and a pointer, `every lane failed (1 of 1); the errors are above`. README.md,
`docs/lanes.md` and the `crapkit-recover` skill show the new line.

### `doctor` counts one file as one file
The per-scope line read `ok   scope 'calc': 1 files`. It is the first proof a reader
gets that a scope path matches anything, and the quickstart publishes it, so the first
crapkit output a new user saw was ungrammatical. The noun now follows the count, and
zero keeps the plural, which is the FAIL case the line exists for.

### The onboarding transcript names no machine and no release
The worked `crapkit doctor --plugin-root` example in `plugin/skills/crapkit-onboard`
was pasted off one machine: it printed that machine's home directory, spelled with the
name of whoever ran it, ending in an install six releases old. A reader matched their
own output against a path nobody else has and a version they were not meant to have.
It now reads `<home>\.claude\plugins\cache\crapkit\crapkit\<version>`, and
`tests/unit/test_skills_contract.py` holds every shipped skill page to it: no home
directory on any of them, and no release number on that line.

## 0.4.10 — 2026-09-01

### The action is named "crapkit complexity gate"
The GitHub Marketplace refuses an action whose name matches an existing user or
organization, and a GitHub user named `craPkit` exists, so `name: crapkit` in
`action.yml` could not be published. The action is now "crapkit complexity gate"; the
`uses:` line a consumer writes is unchanged, since that names the repository, not the
action. A contract test keeps the name from collapsing back to the project's.

## 0.4.9 — 2026-09-01

### The handbook's advisory panel draws the Bash half it has answered since 0.4.7
Section 06 of `docs/handbook.html` pairs a picture of the two hooks with prose about
them. The prose has said since 0.4.7 that the advisory answers `Bash` events off the
working tree; the picture still said it fires after every `Edit` and `Write` and nothing
else. Both sentences sit on one page, fifty lines apart, and a reader who trusted the
picture concluded a heredoc write is never judged.

The panel now states the whole rule: `Edit` and `Write` everywhere, because that is the
matcher `plugin/hooks/hooks.json` ships, plus a `Bash` write in the repos where the
reader registers a second matcher of their own, `*.py` only.
`tests/unit/test_claude_hook_docs_contract.py` reads the panel's own text back out of
the SVG and holds it to the shipped matcher, so the picture cannot fall behind the code
again without a red test.

### The adoption page's whole-suite example keeps the launcher prefix the page requires
`docs/adoption.md` states that every python line `crapkit init` writes names one launcher,
the lockfile's where the repo has one, because step 3 measuring one environment while step
4 tests another is the bug that rule prevents. Twenty lines further down, the
`[crapkit.scoped_tests]` block that is the recommended way out of the two-templated-scopes
trap started at a bare `python`, so the block a reader copies produced exactly that
mismatch on a `uv.lock` repo and nothing failed loudly.

The example now reads `uv run python -m pytest ...`, with a line saying the prefix is the
example repo's own lockfile talking and that a repo with no lockfile names no launcher.
`tests/unit/test_skills_contract.py` pulls every `[crapkit.scoped_tests]` entry out of the
page's fenced toml and holds each one to the launcher names `scaffold.LOCKFILE_RUNNERS`
carries.
### The Bash matcher snippet is parsed on all three pages that print it
README.md, `docs/agent-json.md` and the 0.4.7 section of CHANGELOG.md each carry the
JSON a consumer pastes into their own settings to register the `Bash` half of the
advisory. Nothing loaded any of the three, so a trailing comma, a renamed key or a
timeout that drifted from the shipped one would have shipped green and failed on the
reader's machine.

`tests/unit/test_hook_snippet_contract.py` pulls every fenced json block naming a
matcher off those pages, parses it, and holds it to one `PostToolUse` entry with matcher
`Bash` running one `command` hook, whose command line and timeout are read out of
`plugin/hooks/hooks.json` rather than typed again here.

### Issue-form placeholders stopped naming a release
`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml` offered `crapkit 0.4.0` as the example version
line, and `field_report.yml` offered `crapkit 0.4.7`. A placeholder is what a reporter
pattern-matches against, so a stale one teaches an old number as the normal answer, and
it goes stale again at every release with nothing failing. Both now read `the output of
crapkit --version, unedited`, which cannot age.

`tests/unit/test_issue_forms_contract.py` holds the rule for the next one: every
`placeholder` value under `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` either names the version this tree
ships or names no version at all.
### The advisory's own wording is held to the pages that print it
`_advisory_lines` in `src/crapkit/cli/claude_hook.py` builds the three lines the
PostToolUse hook writes to stderr, and the first of them says outright that the edit
landed and nothing was blocked. That sentence is load-bearing: the reader is a model
holding a nonzero exit code, and the commit gate's own wording would tell it a landed
edit was rejected.

`AGENTS.md`, `docs/agent-json.md` and `docs/handbook.html` each print a rendered sample
of those lines, and nothing compared them with the format string. A new case in
`tests/unit/test_claude_hook_docs_contract.py` reads each page's sample, feeds its count,
ceiling and path back through `_advisory_lines`, and compares the whole line. The values
come from the page and the wording comes from the code, so what is compared is the
wording alone. The closing line, `the commit gate enforces this`, is pinned the same way.

### The istanbul half of the absolute-path refusal is covered end to end
A lane whose artifact measures this checkout but spells every path absolutely joins with
nothing, because the join is root-relative. `src/crapkit/lanes.py` refuses it and picks
the advice from the lane's parser: coverage.py gets `relative_files = true`, istanbul
gets its reporter's own cwd/root option. Only the coveragepy branch had a test.

`tests/e2e/test_lane_absolute_paths_istanbul_e2e.py` runs `crapkit coverage` against a
fixture repo with an istanbul lane and asserts exit 5, the istanbul advice, and none of
the coveragepy advice. Staging it needs a root spelled two ways, since a reporter that
spells it as crapkit does is rebased and joins fine: the lane's script reaches the
checkout through its parent, the way a reporter writes keys when its root option was
joined rather than resolved. Case and symlinks stage the same thing on one platform each;
this spelling stages it on both.
### The action's verdict covers the pull request's own delta
`action.yml` ran `crapkit coverage` and then `crapkit verify` at one commit, so verify's
baseline was the run it had just written and the gate judged no changed function. The
verdict line reported the tree's health and called it a pull request review.

On a `pull_request` event the action now scores the fork point first. It adds a detached
worktree at `git merge-base` of `github.event.pull_request.base.sha` and HEAD under
`RUNNER_TEMP`, runs the consumer's lanes there, and copies that store over the checkout's,
so the checkout's own `crapkit coverage` lands a second run beside it. The verdict step
then runs `crapkit verify --json --reuse-artifacts --base <fork>`, which measures the diff
from there and takes the fork point's run as its baseline. The gate judges the functions
the pull request changed and nothing else, so a repository that was already over its
ceiling before the branch started no longer fails every pull request that touches it.

The fork point rather than `base.sha`: `base.sha` is the base branch's tip when the event
fired, and a base branch that moved after the branch forked carries commits HEAD never
saw. A run there is at neither end of the diff verify would measure, and verify refuses
for want of a run at or behind the real fork. The changed-file list the comment's table
is filtered to moved to `base.sha...HEAD` for the same reason, so both counts in the
comment now describe the branch's own commits.

Measured on a two-commit repository whose second commit adds one uncovered ccn-10
function, running the step bodies against the first commit as the base. 0.4.8's call, and
0.4.9's beside it:

```
verify OK @ 04a8eefdd3d vs baseline 04a8eefdd3d (0 changed files)          # exit 0

verify FAILED @ 04a8eefdd3d vs baseline d2358fe6c0a (1 changed files)      # exit 6
  GATE  crap    110.0  ccn  10 cov 0%  calc/grade.py:8  curve( scores , mode , floor , ceiling , skip_none )  -> decompose
```

The price is two lane runs on a pull request, and the new `delta` input buys it back:
`delta: "false"` skips the base run and keeps 0.4.8's behaviour. A `push` event keeps it
too, having no base commit to score and no pull request to comment on.

Nothing here can fail the job. A shallow clone that does not hold the fork point, a fork
point older than the repo's `crapkit.toml`, and a lane that will not run against that
tree all leave `crapkit base scoring exited N` in the log and no base run behind it, and
the verdict step falls back to the single-commit call. The last of those three is the one
to know about: a lane that measures an installed copy of the package rather than the tree
it runs in would score the checkout while standing on the base commit. crapkit's own
`--cov=crapkit` lane is such a lane, which is why the dogfood job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
sets `delta: "false"`; `crapkit coverage` refuses that artifact (exit 5) rather than
joining it, so the failure is loud and the fallback is automatic.
### A Dockerfile that runs the MCP server over stdio
`Dockerfile` at the repository root builds `crapkit mcp` as an image, for a client or a
registry that starts a server from a Dockerfile rather than from an installed package:

```
docker build -t crapkit .
docker run -i --rm -v "$PWD:/repo" -w /repo crapkit
```

python:3.12-slim, `pip install .` over four copied paths (pyproject.toml, README.md,
LICENSE and src/), and git, which the image needs because every MCP tool shells to the CLI
and the CLI reads git. The server runs as an unprivileged account and serves `/repo`, the
directory the run command mounts. That account also carries
`git config --global --add safe.directory '*'`: a bind mount keeps the host's ownership,
git under a different uid refuses a repo it calls dubious, and the tools would report an
empty history rather than the repo's own.

`.dockerignore` keeps tests, docs and `.crapkit/` out of the build context.
`tests/unit/test_dockerfile_contract.py` reads the Dockerfile the way the action contract
reads `action.yml`: the ENTRYPOINT names a `[project.scripts]` console script and a
subcommand the parser defines, every COPY names a path that exists, and the image installs
git and drops root. [docs/agent-json.md](docs/agent-json.md) documents the two commands
under its MCP section.

## 0.4.8 — 2026-09-01

### A composite action that comments the worklist and the verdict on a pull request
`action.yml` at the repository root makes crapkit four lines in a consumer's workflow:

```yaml
      - uses: JeanFrancoisGagne/crapkit@v0.4.8
        with:
          gate: "false"
```

The action sets up python, installs crapkit, and runs `crapkit coverage --json`,
`crapkit verify --json --reuse-artifacts` and `crapkit worklist --json` in the consumer's
checkout. The three payloads become one comment: what the run measured, the verdict line
with verify's own exit code, and the ranked worklist rows for the files the pull request
changed. A hidden `<!-- crapkit-action -->` line lets the next push find that comment
through the API and edit it, so a fifteen-push branch carries one comment and not fifteen.
A push event has no pull request to carry one, and the same text goes to the job log
instead.

The install reads `$GITHUB_ACTION_PATH`, the action's own checkout, rather than
`pip install crapkit`: the crapkit that scores a tree is the one in the ref the consumer
pinned in `uses:`, so `@v0.4.8` cannot drift to whatever released last.

`gate` decides the exit code. `false`, the default, exits 0 whatever verify found and
leaves the comment as the whole output, which is how a team adopts the action before it
has decided which findings should stop a merge. `true` exits with verify's code, so a
finding fails the check. `top` caps the rendered rows at 5 by default and
`python-version` picks the interpreter. Posting the comment needs `pull-requests: write`
and nothing else.

What the verdict covers is worth reading once. The baseline is the coverage run the same
job wrote a step earlier, so on a clean checkout verify judges an empty diff and reports
the tree's own health rather than the pull request's delta. README's
[The GitHub Action](README.md#the-github-action) says so in the same words and names the
portable baseline that makes it judge the diff instead.

crapkit's own dogfood job runs the action on crapkit with `uses: ./`, on every push and
every pull request. `action.yml` is read by the runner and never imported, so that job is
the only thing that executes its steps; `tests/unit/test_action_contract.py` covers what a
unit test can, which is that the file parses, that every step names its shell, that every
`crapkit` call in it exists on the parser with the flags it passes, and that the marker
the builder writes is the one the action greps for.
### The README and the handbook open with a generated demo
`docs/demo.gif` and `docs/demo.svg` show a 90-second terminal session: `init` sniffing a
small Python repo, `coverage` scoring it, `worklist --top 5` ranking it, a shell heredoc
appending a function at ccn 7 while the per-edit advisory reports it and exits 2, and the
commit gate refusing the staged file with exit 6. The README embeds the GIF under its
badges and the handbook shows it on its first screen.

Nothing in the frames is written by hand. `python tools/demo/generate.py` builds a git
repo from the fixture under `tools/demo/fixture/`, replays its commit plan so the
worklist has real churn to rank, runs those five commands against this checkout's crapkit
and renders what they printed. Every captured line goes through a redaction pass that
strips the temp repo's path, wall-clock stamps and durations, and the generator refuses
to write an image if a machine path survived it. Two runs on an unchanged tree write
byte-identical files, which `tests/unit/test_demo_generator.py` holds them to, so
regenerating the demo for a release is a no-op unless the output actually moved.

The handbook's lanes section also links a new note on pytest-cov 7 and subprocess
coverage, beside the lane rules it belongs to.
### A note on the Pages site: what pytest-cov 7 stopped measuring
`docs/notes/pytest-cov-7-subprocess-coverage.html` writes up the trap that made crapkit
floor `coverage>=7.10.6` and set `[tool.coverage.run] patch = ["subprocess"]` in the first
place, for readers who will never install crapkit. pytest-cov 7.0.0 (2025-09-09) dropped
its own subprocess measurement, so any suite that drives a CLI through `subprocess.run`
loses the coverage of every entry point on upgrade, with nothing printed and the tests
still green.

The numbers on the page are not remembered, they are produced.
`tools/notes/pytest_cov7_repro.py` builds one virtualenv per pytest-cov pin, installs
crapkit editable into each, and runs `tests/e2e/test_init_doctor_e2e.py` four times: two
pins times the patch key present and absent. It toggles the key through
`COVERAGE_RCFILE`, so the tree under measurement is never edited, and writes the executed
and total statement counts for `src/crapkit/cli/admin.py` to
`tools/notes/pytest_cov7_repro.json`. Committed run: 324/521 statements under pytest-cov
6.3.0 with or without the key, 324/521 under 7.1.0 with it, and 0/521 under 7.1.0 without
it. All four runs exited 0.

`tests/unit/test_notes_contract.py` joins the two. Every measurement row on the page has
to match the JSON on the pin, the coverage version, the state of the key and the count, so
a number edited by hand fails the suite.

## 0.4.7 — 2026-08-31

One contributed capability and three fixes. The capability is the per-edit advisory,
which now hears writes that arrive through a shell: PR #45, from @nicolaschapados. The
three fixes are #42, #43 and #44, filed off the review of PR #41, the incident report of
his that became 0.4.6. They are a lane refusal that named the wrong cause, a cause line
hoisted out of a superseded retry attempt, and a commented `init` template that handed
back the environment bug the live lane no longer has. Nothing here is required of a
consumer on upgrade; [Upgrading from 0.4.6](#upgrading-from-046) at the end of this
section has the one thing you may want to choose.

### The per-edit advisory now hears Bash writes
`crapkit claude-hook` judged the one file named in `tool_input.file_path`, which only
Edit, Write and MultiEdit events carry. A `Bash` PostToolUse event carries
`tool_input.command` instead, so an agent writing source through a shell heredoc or
`python - <<'PY'`, which is how some harness modes make every write, got no complexity
advice at all. Found running crapkit 0.4.4 over a real milestone, in the same nested-root
repo that surfaced the 0.4.5 `diff.relative` fixes.

A Bash event now falls back to the working tree: the `*.py` files git reports as dirty or
untracked, whose mtime sits inside a 12-second freshness window, capped at 25 files. Each
one takes the same per-file ladder an Edit takes, so scope, sequencing, changed ranges,
ratchet marks and the untracked rule all mean what they already meant, a nested crapkit
root judges the same root-relative paths the commit gate will, and exit 2 still means one
thing. The freshness window is what keeps a later `ls` from re-advising a file that was
already dirty. A clean tree, a stale file and a cwd outside any git repo are all silence.

Python only, and on purpose: every other language stays the commit gate's business,
because only Python is cheap enough to analyze on every shell call. The shipped plugin
still registers `Edit|Write` alone, so the fallback fires only for a consumer who adds a
`Bash` matcher; the upgrade note below has the snippet and the cost.

The `--protocol` check also moved to the top of the ladder. The outcomes are the same, but
a payload from a future protocol is now answered before the root walk rather than after
it.

### A lane reporting this tree in absolute paths is no longer "another tree"
`_escapes_repo` called a measured path outside the checkout whenever it was absolute,
drive-lettered or climbing out, and never compared it against the repo root. A runner that
reports this checkout's own files by absolute path, which is coverage.py whenever
`relative_files` is off, was refused with the another-tree message and advice about venvs
and `path_prefix`: none of it the cause, and `path_prefix` only ever prepends.

The root now reaches the check and the refusal splits in two. Paths outside the root keep
the old message verbatim. Absolute paths that resolve under it get their own exit 5,
naming the cause (the runner spelled paths absolutely, crapkit joins on root-relative
ones) and the runner's own switch: `relative_files = true` under `[tool.coverage.run]`, or
`[run] relative_files = true` in `.coveragerc`, for a coveragepy lane, the reporter's
`cwd`/`root` option for an istanbul one. Both sides of the comparison resolve the same
way, symlinks followed and the case folded where the filesystem folds it.

Nothing is rebased: the join contract stays root-relative and only the diagnosis moved. A
`../` climb keeps the another-tree refusal, having no recorded working directory to
resolve against, and so does a mixed artifact, where one path from somewhere else decides
for all of them and the count names the outside paths alone. In-tree relative paths that
simply miss every scope still warn and score on, which is the greenfield shape 0.4.6
described. Three readings of zero overlap, three verdicts.

### A retried lane quotes the attempt that failed it
The cause hoisted in front of a lane refusal is now read from the final attempt only.
Every attempt appends to one `.crapkit/lane-<name>.log`, and the scan that looks for a
reason ran over the whole file, so a lane that timed out on an `ImportError` and then
failed attempt 2 for a different reason reported the ImportError, standing above attempt
2's own output with nothing marking the boundary between them. The final attempt starts
after the last `--- attempt N ---` banner line; the banner has to be the whole line, so
output that quotes those words mid-text is still output. Attempt 1 writes no banner, so a
log without one is a single attempt and reads exactly as before. The tail itself still
reads the end of the whole log, and the message names no attempt number: the log path it
already quotes is where that lives.

### The commented lane template names the python the lockfile pins
0.4.6 taught `init` to write `uv run python -m pytest …` off a lockfile, but only where it
detected a live pytest lane. A repo with a lockfile and no pytest marker file
(`pyproject.toml`, `pytest.ini`, `setup.cfg`) gets the coveragepy lane as a commented
template instead, and that template still read a bare `python`. Uncommenting it handed the
reader back the environment bug the prefix exists to prevent.

The template now carries a `{python}` placeholder, filled the same way the
`[crapkit.scoped_tests]` entries already fill theirs, so every python line `init` writes
names one launcher, whether that is the live lane, the scoped-tests entry, or the
commented template that stands in for a lane the repo did not get. `python_launcher` takes
the launcher as its fallback for a repo with no lane to read it back off. The js templates
are unchanged; they carry no placeholder. A repo with no lockfile writes `python` (or
`python3`, or `py`) exactly as before.

`_warn_missing_pytest_cov` now documents the rule it applies rather than the one it used
to. A manager-headed lane names no python in the position the probe reads, so it is never
probed and can never earn the pytest-cov note; it still earns the two notes ahead of the
probe, for a manager that does not resolve on PATH and for a first word the shell cannot
start.

### Upgrading from 0.4.6
- **Nothing is required.** No config key, no ratchet reseed, no stamp change. Every
  0.4.6 config and every committed ratchet reads the same here.
- **One thing you may want to add: a `Bash` matcher for the advisory.** The shipped
  plugin registers `Edit|Write`, so out of the box the new fallback never fires. To get
  it, add a second PostToolUse entry to your own settings, same command, matcher `Bash`:

  ```json
  {
    "hooks": {
      "PostToolUse": [
        {
          "matcher": "Bash",
          "hooks": [
            { "type": "command", "command": "crapkit claude-hook --protocol 1", "timeout": 20 }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
  ```

  The cost is one `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` and one `git status --porcelain -z
  -uall` per shell call inside a git repo, whether or not crapkit measures it: about
  30 ms together on crapkit's own checkout, and it grows with the size of the tree git
  has to walk. The fallback judges `*.py` files only, so a repo whose source is TypeScript
  or Go pays those two spawns and gets nothing back.

## 0.4.6 — 2026-08-31

Three findings from @nicolaschapados, out of one incident on a real pytest/uv project
checked out twice through git worktrees. The incident was not a crapkit bug: the shell
held checkout B's venv while crapkit ran in checkout A, and B's editable install pointed
pytest at B's sources. What crapkit owns is that it made the cause hard to find, and was
one step away from reporting a confident wrong answer instead.

### Reading a failed lane
Every no-artifact refusal now carries `full log: <path>` before the tail it quotes, the
`--reuse-artifacts` one included: it raised its own bare sentence, and the log from the
run that built the artifact was usually still on disk.
`_raise_no_artifact` had the path and never printed it, so a reporter saw 500 bytes of
tail and nothing naming `.crapkit/lane-py.log`; finding the log took a second agent while
ten collection tracebacks sat inside it.

The tail is cut on line boundaries rather than on a byte count, so it can no longer open
mid-line on a fragment that reads like the start of a message (the report that prompted
this opened on `last output:  short test summary info ====`). A line longer than the
budget on its own keeps its end behind an ellipsis, which at least says so.

When the end of the log names no cause, the last few lines that do name one are hoisted
in front of it with an `...` marking the output skipped between them. pytest closes a
collection failure on a block of `ERROR path` lines saying which files broke and never
why, so a plain tail spends its whole budget on filenames while the reason scrolls off
above it.

A hoisted line too long to show whole keeps its END behind an ellipsis. The path that
names the other checkout sits at the end of an `E   ImportError: cannot import name ...`
line, and the cut used to be taken from the right, so on a deep path the one detail worth
hoisting was the one dropped, with nothing saying so.

### An artifact that measured a different tree
Nothing checked that a lane's artifact was about this checkout. Coverage joins on path
and nothing else, so an artifact whose paths reach none of the scopes its lane claims
contributes exactly nothing and every function in those scopes reads `untested`: a
confident `N untested … grade F` assembled out of a tooling mistake, which is worse than
the exit 5 a missing artifact already earns, because it looks like an answer. In the
incident it failed loudly only because the two checkouts' APIs had diverged. Had they
matched, as two worktrees of one branch normally do, the suite would have passed and the
grade would have been fiction.

Zero overlap has two readings, and the measured paths tell them apart:

| Measured paths | Reading | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| absolute, drive-lettered or climbing out of the tree | both parsers rebase an in-tree file to a repo-relative path, so a path that stayed absolute names a file somewhere else | the lane FAILS, exit 5; its scopes fall back to `no-lane`, not `untested` |
| in-tree, just not under the scope (`tests/test_core.py`), or nothing at all | the greenfield shape: a suite importing none of the scoped source yet | a WARNing on stderr, and the run scores on |

The refusal quotes a few of the paths the artifact does name and says what to do about
them, which is not the same sentence for both readers: a coveragepy lane is pointed at
the environment it binds to and at `path_prefix`, an istanbul lane at the artifact
itself, because the istanbul reader rebases every path under this checkout's root and
never reads `path_prefix` at all. The reach half runs after `path_prefix` is applied, so a prefix that fixes the
join is never refused, and it asks `universe.owning_scope`, the same predicate that
assigns files to scopes, so a scope declaring individual files rather than directories is
reached exactly. The escape half asks the path the runner WROTE, with the prefix taken
back off: the prefix is glued onto every key including the absolute ones, and judged on
the key instead, `backend/` + `/other/checkout/a.py` reads as relative, so no lane that
declares a prefix could ever be refused.

Zero overlap is the whole test. A partial overlap has honest readings, a lane measuring
part of a scope or generated files outside it, and any threshold over zero would need
tuning per repo.

### The environment a scaffolded lane binds to
The scaffolded lane was a bare `python -m pytest`, which resolves through the shell's
PATH to whichever venv happens to be active. That was the root cause of the whole report.
A lockfile is the repo naming the manager that owns its environment, and only that
manager's `run` binds a command to it:

| Lockfile at the root | Lane command `init` writes |
|---|---|
| `uv.lock` | `uv run python -m pytest --cov …` |
| `poetry.lock` | `poetry run python -m pytest --cov …` |
| `pdm.lock` | `pdm run python -m pytest --cov …` |
| `Pipfile.lock` | `pipenv run python -m pytest --cov …` |
| none | `python -m pytest --cov …`, unchanged |

`init` now also checks that the manager resolves on THIS machine's PATH, and names it
when it does not: the lockfile is the repo's property, so a `uv.lock` a teammate
committed gets the `uv run` lane on a checkout whose owner installed the dependencies
with pip. Nothing caught that — the start check skips a first word that does not resolve
at all, and the pytest-cov probe declines to provision an environment — so `init` exited
0 pointing at a `crapkit coverage` that exited 5 on `'uv' is not recognized`.

First match wins in that order, so a repo mid-migration between two managers gets the
same config every time. The prefix only prefixes: which python name follows it is still
the first of `python`, `python3`, `py` that resolves, so a Windows PATH carrying only the
launcher gets `uv run py`. The `--junitxml` flag and `results_artifact` 0.4.5 added ride
on the managed lane unchanged.

`[crapkit.scoped_tests]` takes the same prefix, read back off the lane rather than passed
in beside it: step 3 measuring one environment while step 4 tests another is the same bug
one command later.

A managed lane is not probed for pytest-cov. `uv run` and its siblings create or sync the
project environment before running anything, and `init` has no business provisioning one
to ask a question about it. Doctor still asks whether the lane can start, which for a
managed lane is `uv --version`.

### The py lane measures the CLI again on pytest-cov 7

pytest-cov 7.0.0 dropped subprocess measurement. crapkit's `dev` extra asked for
`pytest-cov>=5`, so a fresh `pip install -e ".[dev]"` resolves 7.x, and every CLI entry
point the e2e suite drives through `subprocess.run` went to 0% with nothing said. On
`tests/e2e/test_init_doctor_e2e.py`, `src/crapkit/cli/admin.py` scored 0/498 statements
under pytest-cov 7.1.0 against 315/498 under 6.3.0.

pyproject.toml now sets coverage's own replacement, `[tool.coverage.run] patch =
["subprocess"]`, and floors `coverage>=7.10.6` in the `dev` and `py` extras.
Coverage 7.9 and earlier warn about the unknown key and ignore it, which is the same
silence one warning louder. The same file scores 317/498 under pytest-cov 7.1.0 and 6.3.0 alike.

If your own repo runs a pytest lane over a suite that spawns subprocesses, you want both
lines too; [docs/lanes.md](docs/lanes.md) has the section.

### Fixed

- The three unit tests that probe crapkit's import cost in a child now strip
  `COVERAGE_PROCESS_*` as well as `COV_CORE_*`. `test_pygments_deferral` stripped neither,
  and two of its tests failed under any `pytest --cov` on pytest-cov 6.3.0.

## 0.4.5 — 2026-08-30

A fix release with no new capability: an audit of 0.4.4 through six lenses, with every
finding reproduced twice; a benchmark of every subsystem at consumer scale; and the
field reports from the CodingGraph pilot. The audit filed issues #24 and #25; the pilot
filed #26 through #31 and #37 and sent the pull requests that closed them, #32 through
#40 (PR #23, from @nicolaschapados, was 0.4.4, not this release). After upgrading, run
`crapkit ratchet seed` once, then read [Upgrading from 0.4.4](#upgrading-from-044) at
the end of this section for the five other things that change.

### Windows and lane commands
0.4.4 taught the lane guard cmd.exe's quoting, with two gaps: a quote that opens
mid-token (`--cov-report=json:"a b\py.json"`) was two tokens here and one argument to
cmd.exe, so a good lane was refused; a caret escape (`-k ^"not slow^"`) stayed in the
token and split the value. The cmd.exe reading is now a character walk that toggles on
every quote and honours `^` outside quoted runs, checked against real `cmd.exe` argv on
thirty command shapes. A chained command (`cd tests && python -m pytest --cov ...`,
`... --cov && echo done`) is read one argv per `&&`, `||`, `&` or `|` segment and every
segment that runs the runner is checked, so a second narrowing run after the operator is
still refused and a refusal never names a word from the next command. An empty quoted
argument (`-k ""`) stays an empty argument instead of shifting the next path onto the
flag; a quoted or caret-escaped operator is a word, not a separator; words break on
space, tab and line endings only, as cmd.exe and sh do, so a pasted non-breaking space
no longer splits a value; redirections (`> nul`, `2>&1`) are the shell's and never a
positional; on sh a trailing `;` ends the command. The vitest guard licenses 25
value-taking options (`--workspace`, `--diff`, `--snapshotEnvironment`,
`--coverage.extension` and `--typecheck.tsconfig` joined the list) and the docs list is
generated from the set.

`init`'s pytest-cov probe and `mutate`'s per-mutant timeout both used `capture_output`
under `shell=True`. On Windows the kill hit cmd.exe and `run()` then waited on pipes the
grandchild still held, so a 15 s timeout returned after 29 s and a looping mutant was
never cut. Both now run through one bounded spawn (`procs.run_bounded`): the command
starts in its own process group, and a deadline kills the whole tree (`taskkill /T` on
Windows, `killpg` on POSIX) and waits for it. No orphan suite keeps running after
`mutate` gives up on a mutant or a lane's `timeout_seconds` expires, and the lane log
still streams as before.

A PATH holding only the `py` launcher got a lane naming `python3`, which the first
`coverage` could not run; `py` is now in the fallback chain. The Store `python.exe`
alias (exit 9009, "Python was not found") gets its own note naming the interpreter
cmd.exe cannot run, kept separate from the note for a python that runs pytest with no
pytest-cov installed. The `pip install "crapkit[py]"` line uses double quotes in the
note and in the docs: single quotes do not survive cmd.exe.

`mutate` adds its worker worktrees in parallel, and git's add enumerates the existing
`.git/worktrees/*` entries and dies reading a `commondir` a peer is still building: one
add in about a thousand at four workers on Windows, seen on CI (#25). `worktree_add`
retries once after 50 ms when the message names `worktrees/` and `commondir`, whatever
the git dir is called.

### Roots, paths and scopes
The 0.4.4 churn fix left the pre-commit gate reading `git diff --cached` from the git
top, so under a crapkit root below that top staged paths matched no scope and a function
at twice the ceiling committed with a warning (#24). Every git spawn now runs with
`diff.relative=true` and cat-file requests use `:./path`, which also fixes the nine
siblings that joined top-relative paths against root-relative rows: verify's changed
files, `rescore --gate`, lane reuse (which could republish a stale artifact's score),
`mutate` (which found targets and mutated nothing), the ratchet's rename follow, and the
per-edit advisory's own diff. A staged file above the crapkit root is outside the diff
by design and no longer named.

Every git spawn also runs with `core.quotePath=false`, so a dirty non-ASCII file is no
longer invisible to lane reuse (git quoted it, `ls-files` did not). `coupling`, `brief`
and `worklist --batches` decode git's quoting before joining paths, so a non-ASCII path
is no longer a fake row, and `coupling` drops pairs naming a path git no longer tracks.
`.git` is found by walking up from the root, doctor's commit-graph check included, so
the HEAD fast path fires below the top; `config_value` asks git for the repo's own
setting and no longer reads back the `diff.relative` flag crapkit injects into every
spawn.

The churn caches carry their format in the file name (`churn-cache-v2.json`,
`churn-log-v2.z`), so a 0.4.3 sharing the repo keeps its own caches instead of both
rebuilding on every run. A warm 0.4.4 cache is adopted once and its file removed rather
than orphaned.

Scope ownership was decided three ways (first-declared in scoring, longest-prefix in
test-scoped, prefix-only for lane reuse) and the packet mixed two of them. One predicate
in `universe` now answers everyone, with the deepest declared scope path winning, so
scoring, test-scoped routing, lane reuse and the packet agree; a repo with NESTED scopes
may see files move between scopes on its next scan. A file-valued scope path
(`paths = ["core/hot.py"]`) marks its lane changed.

### Runs, gates and verify
`worklist` and `next-item` could describe different runs, and `ratchet seed` and `prune`
could sign marks off a run `verify` had refused. All four now pick the run their peer
picks, the newest trusted run, and a failed verify sitting above every trusted run is
refused with a line naming it.

`verify --baseline ID` naming a run that exists but cannot serve now says which run it
is, why (a failed verify, a hook run, a partial run, an inventory run) and which runs
can serve, instead of the empty-store line (#27, PR #36).

`verify`'s gate exempts a touched function whose fresh CRAP sits at or under its ratchet
mark, the rule `rescore --gate` already applied, so an edit inside signed debt no longer
passes the commit gates and then meets exit 6 (#29, PR #35); exit 7 stays for a
regression the diff never touched. The pre-commit hook still exempts on the mark's
existence alone, on purpose: a staged blob has no coverage to score.

A lane that wrote no test counts this run gets one line naming the gap instead of a
KeyError (#30, PR #32), and `inventory` no longer dies when a tracked file is missing
from the working tree.

`explain PATH LINE` resolves a start line the way `brief` does, and `_scored_run`
returns named fields.

The twin-key note is printed by the parent after the pool returns, never from a worker
whose stderr never saw the UTF-8 reconfigure, so on Windows its em dash no longer lands
as a lone cp1252 byte (#31, PR #33).

### Analysis
Shell cognitive complexity nests: `fi`, `done` and `esac` close a level, so a 4-deep
`if` reads 10 like every other language, not 4. That is analysis version 8. Cognitive
complexity is reported and never gated, ccn does not move, and no other language moves,
but the ratchet still refuses to weigh fresh scores against marks another metric
produced, so see [Upgrading from 0.4.4](#upgrading-from-044).

### Performance
A benchmark of every subsystem on a 31,459-file consumer (152k functions, 41,544 marks,
541 MB of lane artifacts, 72,653 commits) produced 76 improvement candidates. Skeptics
re-implemented and re-measured each one and killed most; these six survived and shipped,
each with its A/B on that corpus.

`coupling`, `worklist --batches` and `brief` stop re-pairing the churn log on every warm
run. A ranked-pairs cache sits at `.crapkit/coupling-cache-v1.json` beside the churn
caches, keyed on HEAD plus the window plus a digest of the tracked set; `--min-support`
or `--min-confidence` off the defaults bypasses it, and `--top` reads it. Warm
`coupling` 1.05 s -> 0.11 s, batches -62%, a single `brief` -25%.

`brief --batch N` shingles the snapshot once per batch instead of once per packet: batch
5 in 11.8 s -> 5.2 s, output byte-identical. An on-disk shingle cache was refuted
outright, because shingles are built on Python's per-process randomized hash.

`doctor` probes each distinct lane runner once, not once per lane: 7.5 s -> 1.4 s on 14
lanes over 2 runners.

`trend` and `report` read per-run rollups instead of rescanning 4.3 M rows. The new
`run_rollup` table is filled once per run and pruned with its run: `trend`
4.58 s -> 0.04 s warm, `report` -76%. Both commands write now, best effort; see
[Upgrading from 0.4.4](#upgrading-from-044).

`verify` reads each istanbul artifact once for coverage, dead lines and its digest
together, and skips the artifact walk on an empty diff: 25.5 s -> 18.9 s, peak memory
+55 MB, all digests byte-identical.

`mutate` keeps its worker worktrees under `.crapkit/mutate-pool/` and re-prepares them
per run: 30.6 s -> 0.46 s of setup on the big tree. `crapkit mutate --drop-pool`
reclaims the disk, and single-worker runs are untouched.

Four candidates were refereed and rejected, named here so nobody rebuilds them: skipping
verify when HEAD and the dirty names are unchanged (the key cannot see a second edit to
an already-dirty file), serving MCP tool calls from a kept process (a stale `source`
breaks the packet contract), parallel git date slices for the churn walk, and a faster
JSON decoder.

### Doctor, init and the plugin
`doctor` WARNs on a coveragepy or istanbul lane that declares no `results_artifact`,
names the two checks that cannot run for it (the crashed-worker check and the
no-new-failures check, exit 8) and prints the line that fixes it; `init` writes
`--junitxml` plus `results_artifact` on the pytest and JS lanes it detects (#26,
PR #38).

`doctor` reads a lane command with the shell that runs it, so a quoted interpreter path
is one word, a runner after `&&` is checked, and a path inside a quoted `-k` is a value.
A lane whose first word will not start is now a FAIL instead of a clean report. The
pytest-cov probe asks the python that runs pytest, so `coverage run -m pytest` is left
alone.

`doctor --plugin-root` takes the plugin root or any directory above it, `~/.claude`
included, where the newest crapkit install under it wins; with no path it reads Claude
Code's plugin cache itself. It names the root it chose (#28, PR #39).

The packet spells its commands as the console script (`crapkit rescore ... --gate`), the
form the docs promise and the one that resolves from a venv on Windows (#37, PR #40).

### Tests and repo
An architecture review of the 0.4.5 tree proposed 37 deepening refactors. Two skeptics
per candidate refuted 36 of them, because every seam they asked for already existed, and
reproduced ten defects on the way; each of those is fixed above, behind the seam that
was already there.

`tests/unit` now drives `verify` and `coverage` in process (`cli/verifying.py` 34% ->
100%, `cli/scoring.py` 43% -> 99% statement coverage from the unit suite alone), and
`tests/e2e` shares one CLI runner in `conftest.py` and runs in about 1m30 with `-n 8`.
The unit suite is 2,283 tests.

The review left one structural item open: `discover.py`, 384 lines with no importer
since birth, is either wired into the packet or removed in a later release.

### Docs
A section on running crapkit with its root below the repo top; the vitest guard page
lists every option whose value it licenses, pinned by a test; the `crapkit-recover`
skill routes the pytest half of "no coverage provider" to the pytest docs.

### Upgrading from 0.4.4
- **Run `crapkit ratchet seed` once.** Shell cognitive complexity now nests, which is
  analysis version 8, and `verify` exits 3 on marks stamped under version 7:
  `ratchet marks were recorded under [crapkit-analysis=7 ...] but this run measures
  [crapkit-analysis=8 ...]`. Seeding re-baselines the marks against the latest run and
  restamps the file. Cognitive complexity is reported, never gated, and ccn does not
  move, so no CRAP score changes: the reseed is there to make the stamp match.
- **New cache files appear under `.crapkit/`:** `coupling-cache-v1.json`, plus
  `churn-cache-v2.json` and `churn-log-v2.z` in place of the 0.4.4 churn cache, which is
  read once and then deleted. All of it is derived data, and `init` already puts
  `.crapkit/` in `.gitignore`.
- **`trend` and `report` write now.** The first run of either sums every existing run
  into `run_rollup`, and changing `target` or a scope's target keys a new ceiling and
  makes it sum them again. The write is best effort: when another crapkit process holds
  the store's write lock, the command still prints its answer and pays the scan next
  time.
- **A repo with NESTED scopes may see files move between scopes** on its next scan,
  because the deepest declared scope path now wins for scoring, test-scoped routing,
  lane reuse and the packet alike. Per-scope rollups and ceilings shift for those files.
  A repo whose scopes do not nest sees no change.
- **`mutate` with `mutation_workers > 1` keeps a worktree pool.** Its workers now live
  under `.crapkit/mutate-pool/` between runs and are re-prepared each run. The pool is
  not size-bounded; `crapkit mutate --drop-pool` removes it and exits. Single-worker runs
  are untouched.
- **`doctor` WARNs on a 0.4.4 lane with no `results_artifact`** and prints the fix. For
  a pytest lane named `py` that reads: add `--junitxml=.crapkit/cov/junit-py.xml` to the
  command and `results_artifact = ".crapkit/cov/junit-py.xml"` to the lane. Coverage is
  unaffected; what the lane cannot feed is the crashed-worker check and the
  no-new-failures check (exit 8).

## 0.4.4 — 2026-08-29

Three field fixes from @nicolaschapados (PR #23) against a real pytest/uv project,
plus the Windows half of the first one. No new capability.

### The lane guard reads a command line like the shell does
Lane commands run under `shell=True`, but both lane lints tokenized them with a
whitespace split. `python -m pytest -m "not live and not perf" --cov ...` was
refused with "positional argument 'live' narrows a full-suite coverage run" —
an argument the shell never hands pytest — and on the istanbul side a QUOTED
positional filter slipped past the guard, because the trailing quote defeated
the suffix check. Both lints now read the command the way the shell that runs
it will: sh on POSIX, and on Windows cmd.exe, where `'` is an ordinary
character and `\` a path separator. So `tests\unit` still reads as the path it
is, and a single-quoted value is refused on Windows with a hint to write it in
double quotes: cmd.exe would hand pytest five words and the lane would write no
artifact. A command the shell would refuse (an unbalanced quote) falls back to
the whitespace read instead of failing config load. The vitest guard learned the
flags whose value can end in a source suffix (`--coverage.exclude`,
`--coverage.include`, `--setupFiles`, `--globalSetup`, `-t`, ...), so a quoted
glob after one is a value, not a filter. Refusals name the token as written.

### A crapkit root below the repo top no longer reads as all-dormant
Scored rows are `git ls-files` paths, relative to the crapkit root; the churn
log came from `git log --name-only`, whose paths are relative to the repo top.
With the root one directory down (a monorepo member, or a project nested
inside a linked worktree's checkout) every churn lookup missed, and `worklist`
filed the entire corpus under dormant ("0 active, 215 dormant" on a repo with
90 commits that week). The churn log now runs with `--relative`, so its paths
join against the rows everywhere — worklist, next-item, brief and coupling
alike — and both churn caches carry a format marker that retires maps laid
down with top-relative paths.

### The first-run pytest-cov trap is named at init, not after the suite
The generated py lane runs `pytest --cov`, and the `--cov` flags come from
pytest-cov — a package of the repo's own interpreter, which a dependency on
crapkit could never guarantee (a pipx or uv-tool install shares nothing with
the suite's venv). `init` now probes the python its lane will run and prints
the install command when `pytest_cov` is not importable, a new `crapkit[py]`
extra pulls the plugin alongside crapkit for same-venv installs, and
`coverage`'s exit-5 hint stays as the last resort. The probe runs through the
same shell as the lane, so a bare `python` resolves to the interpreter the lane
will get, and only a lane init actually wrote is probed: a TypeScript repo whose
`pyproject.toml` holds ruff config gets no note about a suite it has no lane for.

## 0.4.3 — 2026-08-29

Fixes from a second consumer repo's field reports (issues #1, #14–#19, #21, #22).
No new capability; one key format grows, backward compatibly.

### A run nobody finished is not a measurement (#21, #16)
A lane's junit is now read as a trust check. pytest-xdist does not reschedule a
crashed worker's queue; on a 15,300-test lane one dead worker left 4,626 tests
unexecuted while coverage.py still wrote its JSON, and crapkit recorded a full
baseline. A junit carrying `worker 'gwN' crashed` or a session-level error now
fails the lane at exit 5 like a missing artifact, and `coverage` warns when a
lane's test count drops more than 10% below the last trusted run. `ratchet seed`
and `prune` now share `verify`'s trust rule: a failed verify never supplies the
scores they read, and the output line says which run was skipped.

### A measurement that bounced is not an improvement (#15)
`verify` tightens marks on a clean pass, which turned nondeterministic coverage
into a mark oscillator (20.0 → 72.0 → 20.0 on an unchanged tree). It now holds any
mark whose CRAP moved by more than `tighten_max_jump` (default 2.0) against the same
commit's previous scored run, printing one line per held mark; `--no-tighten` is
the blunt escape.

### Same-named functions each get their own key (#17)
Several functions with one name in one file (dataclass `__post_init__`s, C `#ifdef`
forks) shared a single ratchet/gate key, so only the last was marked or gated. The
key now carries a file-order ordinal: the first twin keeps the bare name, then
`name#2`, `name#3`. Existing marks stay valid as twin #1; no rewrite needed.

### The lane guard reads a command line like pytest does (#19, #22)
`-n 8`, `-o timeout=300`, `-p no:randomly` no longer fail as "narrowing
positionals"; the guard knows which options take a value, treats `key=value` as
never a path, and the refusal message names the attached-value rewrite.

### `duplication` skips a closure and the factory around it (#1)
Nesting pairs scored 1.0 by construction and drowned the report (43 of 43 pairs on
the reporting repo). They are dropped; kept pairs carry a `contained` flag.

### Plugin and docs (#14, #18)
`plugin/.mcp.json` spawns the `crapkit` console script, the same rule the hooks
use, so a `uv tool` install no longer gets a dead MCP server. The install docs gain
an "Upgrading on Windows" note: a live MCP server holds the launcher exe, `uv tool
upgrade` fails on the copy, and the rename-aside remedy.

## 0.4.2 — 2026-08-29

Fixes from a fresh-user verification pass: five simulated strangers followed the
published docs verbatim, and these are the places the tool or the docs lied.

### cc-only repos can follow the 60-second start
A repo whose languages all score on complexity alone (Go, Rust, shell, PowerShell,
Swift, the C family, Java, Zig, Objective-C) dead-ended at `crapkit coverage`
("no [[lane]] to run"). `init` now writes `coverage_optional = true` on every scope that
cannot have a coverage lane, `coverage` writes a real scored run for such repos, and
`worklist`, `next-item`, `rescore --gate`, `ratchet seed`, and `verify` all accept it.
A mixed repo (Python plus Rust, say) scores its coverage lane and its cc-only scopes in
the same run; nothing lands in `skipped_no_lane` for a scope that never needed a lane.

### Bare names for Rust and Go
`brief` and `next-item`'s `handle` derived the bare identifier by splitting the long
name on `(`, which Rust and Go long names do not carry. The bare name now comes from
the leading identifier, so `brief rust/lib.rs route` works. `explain` and `brief` share
one match rule: exact name first, prefix only when nothing matches exactly.

### Cognitive complexity counts a Rust `match`
The corrected Rust reader fixed ccn but cognitive still read 0 for a `match`; it now
counts like a switch (one plus nesting), so a match and its if/else-if twin agree.

### CI
Every test job failed, on both operating systems, because the suite's fixture lane
assumed pytest-xdist and the CI install did not ship it; the badge told every visitor
the project was broken. The dev extra now carries every plugin the fixture lanes need,
CI installs that extra, and a contract test pins both. CI also stops swallowing
crapkit's own gate: a commit over the ceiling now fails the build.

### Docs
Real `doctor` and `next-item` transcripts (the old samples predated 0.4.x); the gate
table says what `git commit` actually returns (the hook exits 6, git reports 1); the
vitest provider install is pinned to your vitest major; the published handbook's two
links out no longer 404; the packet field count and the PowerShell switch-arm rule now
match the code.

## 0.4.1 — 2026-08-29

A documentation and packaging release. No scoring or gate behavior changed.

- Every document rewritten for the 0.4.0 feature set in plain language: the README leads
  with the 60-second start and the plugin, the handbook gains a "two gates" section
  (the per-edit advisory versus the commit gate) and a walk-through for each of the six
  ways people run the tool, `docs/ratchet.md` leads with the changed gate semantics, and
  the skills name the new agent moments.
- The handbook is published at https://jeanfrancoisgagne.github.io/crapkit/handbook.html.
- PyPI metadata: project links, true classifiers, keywords; `pip install crapkit` is now
  the documented install everywhere.
- Contributor files: issue forms (bug, feature, language request), a pull-request
  template, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, and `SECURITY.md` with the tool's threat surface.
- Corrected the supported-language count: fourteen (TypeScript and TSX count separately).

## 0.4.0 — 2026-08-28

### Eight new languages
`rust`, `shell`, `cpp` (the whole C family: `.c .cc .cpp .cxx .h .hpp`), `objectivec`,
`vue`, `java`, `zig`, and `powershell` join the supported set — every one admitted only
after a hand-counted probe battery against lizard 1.24.0, and three of them on
crapkit-corrected readers:

- **Rust** ships a corrected reader: upstream lizard scores a 7-arm `match` as ccn 2
  (filed as lizard #494); crapkit counts each non-wildcard arm like a C `case`, so the
  same match scores 7. The module retires itself the day upstream fixes it.
- **shell** and **powershell** are new readers (lizard has neither): function-level
  ccn and cognitive, heredoc/here-string/quote/comment hazards each pinned by test,
  validated against real fleet scripts. PowerShell files in cp1252 decode via a
  narrow fallback instead of erroring.
- **C family**: one `cpp` label (lizard has a single reader for C and C++). Two
  defects are mitigated in crapkit: `#ifdef` fork arms that produce duplicate
  `(path, long_name)` records now warn at analyze time, and cognitive complexity no
  longer counts rvalue-reference `&&` in C++ parameter lists.

`ANALYSIS_VERSION` is 6; stores re-analyze on the next run. Coverage stays wherever a
lane exists; the new languages score cc-only until then (`coverage_optional = true`).

### The Claude Code plugin
The repo now carries an installable plugin: three skills, the MCP server, and a
per-edit advisory hook, installed once per user —

```
claude plugin marketplace add JeanFrancoisGagne/crapkit
claude plugin install crapkit@crapkit
```

Repos without a `crapkit.toml` cost a silent sub-50 ms no-op per edit; repos with one
get the full ladder with zero files added to the repo.

### `crapkit claude-hook`
A native subcommand speaking Claude Code's hook protocol (versioned: `--protocol 1`).
Advisory by design — PostToolUse cannot block, so the wording says so — with a strict
silence ladder: no config, unscoped file, mid-rebase, malformed input, or any internal
error exits 0 with no output. It never opens the store and never writes a file. A
breach prints the advisory to stderr and exits 2, which reaches the model as feedback.
Unknown `claude-*` subcommands exit 0 silently, so a plugin newer than the CLI
degrades to silence instead of an argparse usage dump.

### The commit gate and the advisory now agree
`hook-precommit` exempts functions that carry a ratchet mark (existence), matching the
advisory's exemption: signed debt no longer refuses a commit when merely touched.
`verify` still fails any mark that rises. One stderr line reports how many marked
functions were exempted.

### Faster rescore
`rescore` reads only the rescored files' rows instead of the whole scored run
(799.5 ms → 0.8 ms on a 100k-function store). `crapkit watch` inherits the win.

### doctor --plugin-root
Compares an installed plugin's version and hook protocol against the CLI and reports
drift in one line.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-08-28

### Correct cognitive complexity for Swift and Kotlin
Every Swift and Kotlin function scored cognitive 0: lizard's `SwiftReplaceLabel.preprocess`
materializes the token stream, draining any extension registered ahead of it. Those two
readers now get their own extension chain with the cognitive extension after lizard's
preprocessing; every other language keeps the existing chain. A 6-branch probe now scores
cognitive 10 in Python, TypeScript, Swift, and Kotlin alike. `ANALYSIS_VERSION` is 4, so
stores re-analyze on the next run. The upstream defects that block Kotlin and Rust
admission are filed as lizard #493 (Kotlin expression bodies missing from the function
list) and #494 (Rust match arms not counted).

### Go, cc-only
`go` joins the supported languages: complexity and the worklist, no coverage parser
(the coverprofile format carries no function records, and mapping blocks to spans
scored an untested function as fully covered in review — so it stays out).
`**/*_test.go` joins the default excludes. Scopes that cannot have a coverage lane
declare `coverage_optional = true`.

### `crapkit report`
One self-contained HTML page (`.crapkit/report.html`): the top-50 worklist, per-scope
grades, and the trend series — rendered from the same payloads the JSON commands print,
so the page cannot rank a different function first than the command just did. A per-lane
staleness banner names exactly which lane's artifact no longer describes the tree.

### verify emits uncovered changed lines as SARIF
New rule `crapkit/diff-uncovered`: one warning-level finding per changed line no lane
ran, the full list rather than the stderr 20-line preview. `uncovered` artifact reading
now refuses unknown parsers with the same error lanes use, instead of silently reading
them as coverage.py output.

### Small fixes
`.cjs` counts as a source suffix in lane-command checks; the caller-discovery pattern
matches Go `func` and Kotlin/Swift `fun`/`func` definitions; Swift range operators
`..<`/`...` are protected from mutation (two previously uncompilable mutants); the
README names the actual supported language set.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-08-24

### The start-editing packet

`brief --json` is now step one of the burn-down loop, not step two. An agent reads
the payload instead of opening the file, grepping for callers and running `git log`.
Every field is additive and `schema` stays `1`; every existing text output and JSON
field is byte-identical.

- `brief --json` gains `source` (the function's own text), `params` (its parameter
  names), `file_functions` and `file_totals` (the rest of the file, and its rollup),
  `gate_rule` (`ceiling`, `binds`, `ratchet_mark`, `mark_age_days`,
  `diff_uncovered_max`: what the edit will be judged by), `commands` (`gate`,
  `scoped_tests`, `verify`, `refresh`, already written for this file and scope),
  `lane`, `stale`, `versions`, `attempts`, `regrowth` (whether an earlier
  decomposition of this function did not hold) and `notes`.
- `coupling[]` gains `is_test`; `duplication_twins[]` gains `contained`.
- `brief NAME` takes the function's start line as a third name form. It settles a bare
  name two functions share, and it is the only handle on a function printed
  `(anonymous)`.
- `brief --batch N --json` returns `{schema, run_id, commit, stale, packets[]}`: the
  top N of the queue as N packets from one read of the store, the churn log and the
  ratchet file, for an orchestrator dealing work to a fleet.
- `next-item` gains `stale`, the field `worklist` already carried.
- `explain --json` emits what the plain output prints, and `--history` commits now
  carry their message `body`.
- `crapkit.toml` gains `[crapkit] notes` and per-scope `notes`, free-text house rules
  that ride into every packet. `doctor` warns about a scope a lane measures with no
  `[crapkit.scoped_tests]` template behind it, which leaves `commands.scoped_tests`
  null and the loop's step 4 with nothing to run.

### Performance

31 measured, adversarially verified improvements. No
scoring change (ccn identical on every function by differential test), no
schema change on any JSON output, stdout byte-identical on every read command.

- Churn: the raw log is cached deflated (`.crapkit/churn-log.z`) and refreshed
  from `cached..HEAD` instead of rewalked; `brief` and `worklist --batches`
  drop 60-80% of their wall time, `coupling` and the per-file map read through
  the same log.
- Startup: one command family imported per invocation; ~35-40 ms off every
  command, which also multiplies through every MCP `tools/call`.
- Store: identity-led index layout, integer verdict codes, deflated lane
  records; about 30% smaller on disk with faster reads. Crash-safe migration
  on first open (the file grows until the next `runs prune` or a manual
  `VACUUM` reclaims the rewritten pages).
- Analysis: one lizard pass instead of two (-40% cold), cognitive complexity
  now deterministic (state keyed on the function, not a reused `id()`),
  streamed cache writes, opt-in `CRAPKIT_ANALYSIS_MEMORY_MB` pool bound.
- Memory: coverage artifacts parse in O(chunk) not O(file); `duplication`
  releases source texts after shingling; `watch` polls with scandir.
- Hook: serial below 16 staged files, staged blobs analyzed in memory,
  pygments kept out of the process, HEAD read from the ref files.
- `lane_order` re-keys stamps so a renamed artifact path no longer orphans its
  recorded duration (silently defeating longest-first lane scheduling).
- `doctor` warns when the repo's commit-graph lacks changed-path Bloom filters.
- SARIF output is compact now (decoded-equal, deterministic, ~30% smaller
  files, 5x faster to write).

## 0.1.0

First public release.

- Per-function CRAP scoring (`ccn^2 x (1-cov)^3 + ccn`, ccn = min of standard
  and modified cyclomatic complexity) for TypeScript, TSX, JavaScript, and
  Python via lizard, with Sonar-spec cognitive complexity as a reporting column.
- Coverage lanes (istanbul and coverage.py parsers) with timeouts, retries,
  flake re-test, artifact provenance, and parallel execution.
- Churn-weighted worklist, `next-item`, session claims, disjoint-file batch
  planning, and a one-call `brief` payload for coding agents.
- Hard complexity gate on touched functions (pre-commit hook and `verify`),
  committed ratchet with metric-version stamp, rename following, debt policy,
  and an audited override trail.
- `verify` with merge-base diff scoping, portable TSV baselines, dirty-tree
  attribution, and receipt fields; SARIF and GitHub annotations output.
- `doctor` (config, lanes, unclaimed files, unmeasured directories, committed
  hooks that are not executable in the index, `--json`, `--tune`), `init` with
  test-runner detection and a commented `[crapkit.scoped_tests]` stub,
  diff-scoped mutation testing, duplication and change-coupling analysis,
  `watch`, and a read-only MCP server.
- Lane artifacts live under `.crapkit/cov/`: `init` scaffolds them there using
  each runner's own flag (`--cov-report=json:`, `--coverage.reportsDirectory`,
  `--coverageDirectory`), and `doctor` warns about a lane that writes at the
  repo root instead.
- A failed `verify` holds the baseline: runs taken after it are skipped by the
  default baseline selection until some `verify` passes, so a `coverage` run on
  the refused tree can no longer retire the finding. `verify` names the run it
  refused and both escapes, and `runs list` marks the run it compares against.
- `worklist` and `next-item` are documented as two views of one run. The
  worklist row carries an `ok` or `no-lane` marker and its JSON entries carry
  `flag` and `remedy`, so a wiring gap and a finished repo are visible without
  a second call.
- A function's scope, path and long name are stored once, in an `identities`
  table, instead of on every row of every run. An existing store migrates on
  the first open — one transaction, the old table swapped in last, so an
  interrupt changes nothing — and `runs prune` hands the freed pages back. On a
  1.1M-row store: 246 MB down to 131 MB, and 32 MB down to 14 MB per run
  written. Every read returns what it returned before, in the same order.
