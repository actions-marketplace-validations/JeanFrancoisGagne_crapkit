Use when the session already names crapkit (crapkit.toml, .crapkit/, crapkit-ratchet.tsv, a CRAP score, `crapkit next-item`, `crapkit brief`), when the user asks to burn down debt or lower complexity in a repo crapkit measures, when a commit is refused with \"crapkit: commit blocked by the complexity gate\", \"crapkit gate: N staged function(s) exceed the complexity ceiling\" or \"decompose before committing\", or when an edit draws the mid-session advisory \"crapkit advisory: N function(s) over ceiling C\". Not for eslint, husky, or any other pre-commit gate."

# Working a crapkit item

One item at a time. The packet carries the file so you never open it, `gate_rule.ceiling` is
the number the edit is judged against, and `crapkit verify` is the only authoritative
verdict. Every link below points at the crapkit repo on GitHub, because the repo this
session works in does not hold those pages.

## What answers each moment

| Moment | What answers it |
|---|---|
| Before opening the file | `crapkit brief PATH NAME --json`, or the MCP `get_function_brief` tool where the server is registered |
| Which house rules bind here | `notes.repo` and `notes.scope` in the packet |
| An advisory fired on the edit you just made | Decompose that function now, not at the commit wall. The edit landed and nothing was blocked, but the gate refuses the same function later |
| An advisory fired after a Bash command, not an edit | The same verdict, read off the working tree. See [After a shell write](#after-a-shell-write) |
| Before committing | `crapkit rescore FILE --gate` |
| The gate says a staged function carries a ratchet mark | Nothing. The repo signed for that function, so the commit gate skips it. `crapkit verify` still fails a mark that rises |
| Where does new code go | `crapkit worklist --top N`, `crapkit coupling`, `crapkit duplication` |
| Which branches need tests | `uncovered_lines` and `est_uncovered_paths` in the packet |
| Running the owning scope's tests | `commands.scoped_tests`, run verbatim, never retyped |
| Before a PR | `crapkit verify --reuse-artifacts`, or `crapkit verify --base REF` |
| Did the last refactor hold | `crapkit explain PATH NAME`, and the packet's `regrowth` |
| What this session changed | `crapkit digest` |
| Handing the state to a human who will not run a command | `crapkit report`, which writes `.crapkit/report.html` and prints the path |
| Boy-scout scan of the file | `file_functions` and `file_totals` in the packet |
| A lane command crapkit refuses on Windows | Write the value in double quotes. cmd.exe does not treat `'` as a quote, so a single-quoted value reaches the runner one word per space and the guard reads a positional |
| `crapkit doctor` WARNs that a lane declares no `results_artifact` | Coverage is measured either way. Two checks go dark for that lane's scopes until it names a junit file: the crashed-worker trust check, and exit 8, the no-new-failures check |
| `trend` or `report` writing in a checkout you meant to keep read-only | Both fill a per-run rollup cache in the store. `commands.refresh_writes_run` marks a new coverage run; it does not promise that the other packet commands leave the filesystem unchanged |
| `mutate` left worktrees behind | Every worker uses a kept worktree, including the default of one. `crapkit mutate --drop-pool` reclaims them. See [mutation worktrees](https://github.com/JeanFrancoisGagne/crapkit/blob/main/docs/configuration.md#mutation-worktrees) for preparation, concurrent runs and cleanup |

Field semantics live in [docs: the brief payload](https://github.com/JeanFrancoisGagne/crapkit/blob/main/docs/agent-json.md#brief);
the five-step loop lives in [AGENTS: the packet](https://github.com/JeanFrancoisGagne/crapkit/blob/main/AGENTS.md#1-the-packet).

## After a shell write

A `Bash` PostToolUse event carries the command and never a file path, so source written
through a heredoc or a `python - <<PY` block names no file for the hook to judge. It falls
back to the working tree: the `*.py` files git reports dirty or untracked whose mtime
lands inside a 12-second window, at most 25 of them, each through the same per-file ladder
an Edit takes. Scope, sequencing, ratchet marks and the untracked rule mean what they
already meant, and exit 2 means what it always meant: an advisory block naming the functions the write
pushed over their ceiling, with nothing blocked. A Bash event judges each fresh file on
its own, so one event can print one block per file.

Only Python. Every other language stays the commit gate's business.

This fires only where the consumer registered a `Bash` matcher of their own; the shipped
plugin registers `Edit|Write`. A clean tree, a file older than the window, or a shell call
outside any repo all stay silent, so what an advisory names here is source written seconds
ago, never the tree's standing debt.

## Two fields decide whether a number is worth reading

Read `stale` and `uncovered_lines_note` first. `stale: true` means the run predates HEAD:
run `commands.refresh` before anything else. `uncovered_lines: null` means no artifact named
lines for this file, and `flag` says which case you are in:

- `untested`: write the first test at the public seam, then `crapkit coverage`. The lines appear. The exception is `remedy: split-lines`: another function shares the source lines, or a Python def's body starts on the line its signature ends, so no test moves the score. Put each definition on its own lines, and such a def's body on its own line after the signature, first.
- `measured`: the artifact no longer matches the tree. Commit or revert the edits, then `crapkit coverage`.
- `cc-only`: the scope sets `coverage_optional`, so only decompose clears it. Most languages land here, because only Python and JS/TS have coverage parsers.
- `[]`: the artifact answered and nothing is dark.

## Decompose: subtract first

A dead branch deleted drops ccn for free and needs no new name. Then extract private
helpers, picking names `file_functions` shows the file does not hold yet. Over the ceiling
and unsure where the cut goes: read [cuts.md](cuts.md).

One function that is a whole command handler rather than one decision is a redesign, not a
split. Say so and stop.

## With tdd

The packet supplies what `tdd` otherwise asks a user for. `params`, `file_functions` and the
module's exports are the pre-agreed seam. `gate_rule.ceiling` is the pre-agreed scope.
Everything else about writing the test first comes from `tdd`.

## One packet per function you actually edit

A packet is large and mostly source text. Trajectory questions (did this fall and come back,
when did it get worse, which commits touched it) go to `crapkit explain PATH NAME`, which
answers them far cheaper.

## Where a repo trap goes

A trap you learn about the repo goes into its `crapkit.toml` `notes`, repo-wide or under the
owning scope, where every future packet carries it. Keys are documented in
[docs: configuration](https://github.com/JeanFrancoisGagne/crapkit/blob/main/docs/configuration.md).
This file stays repo-free.

## Naming an anonymous function

The packet's `handle` field is the stable form: `(anonymous)#N` names the Nth anonymous
function in the file, counted by start line. `crapkit brief` and `crapkit claims` both take
it. The function's start line is the fallback handle.

## Routing

- A command refused (exit 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9, a lane with no artifact, a ratchet conflict), or printed a line that reads like a refusal and is not: the `crapkit-recover` skill.
- An unattended or multi-phase run: `show-me-your-work`, with `verify`'s `run_id` in the evidence cell.
