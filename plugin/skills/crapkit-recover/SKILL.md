description: "Recover a crapkit run that refused, and tell a real refusal from a line that only looks like one: which exit code means what, the seven causes behind a lane that wrote no artifact, the tainted-baseline escape, and why a crapkit-ratchet.tsv conflict goes to `crapkit ratchet merge` and never to hand-resolution. Use when a crapkit command exits 3/5/6/7/8/9, a lane reports \"produced no artifact\" or \"wrote no artifact this run\", doctor says a shell \"cannot run\" a lane's first word or that a lane \"declares no results_artifact\", a run \"cannot serve as a baseline\", marks \"were recorded under\" another metric version, a ratchet regression names a function you never touched, verify reports a tainted baseline, seed or prune refuses an \"ambiguous legacy function identity\", git conflicts crapkit-ratchet.tsv, `crapkit claude-hook` exits 2 with an advisory, or `crapkit doctor --plugin-root` reports drift."

# Recovering a refused run

Route by the string the command printed. Every row names the one command to run before you
decide anything. The links point at the crapkit repo on GitHub, because the repo this
session works in does not hold those pages.

## Lines that are not failures

Start here. Each of these reads like a refusal and none of them stopped anything.

| What printed | What it means | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| "crapkit advisory: N function(s) over ceiling C in PATH (the edit landed; nothing was blocked)", exit 2 from `crapkit claude-hook` | The PostToolUse hook judged a function the edit changed. PostToolUse runs after the write and cannot block | Decompose that function now. The commit gate refuses it later, with more work stacked behind it |
| "crapkit gate: N staged function(s) carry a ratchet mark and were not gated — `crapkit verify` fails a mark that rises" | The commit gate exempted debt the ratchet already signed for. The commit went through | Nothing. Only `crapkit verify` judges whether a mark rose |
| "crapkit doctor: the plugin at PATH is version X, and the crapkit its hooks spawn (CLI_PATH) is Y", exit 1 | The plugin and the crapkit on PATH ship as separate artifacts and drifted apart; the line names which executable answered | Reinstall whichever is behind: `claude plugin install crapkit@crapkit`, or reinstall the CLI |
| "crapkit doctor: checking PATH", then nothing | You named a directory above the plugin root and doctor found the install under it. The line says which tree the verdict is about | Nothing. Exit 0 means the plugin and the CLI agree |
| "WARN lane 'py' declares no results_artifact: the crashed-worker check and the no-new-failures check (exit 8) cannot run for it", from `crapkit doctor` | The lane measures coverage exactly as before. What it cannot feed are the two checks that read a test-results file | Add the junit flag and `results_artifact` the WARN prints. Until then exit 8 can never fire for that lane's scopes: [AGENTS: when a lane will not start](https://github.com/JeanFrancoisGagne/crapkit/blob/main/AGENTS.md#when-a-lane-will-not-start) |
| "warning: crapkit-ratchet.tsv carries no metric stamp (written before stamping)", from `crapkit verify` | The marks file predates stamping, so nothing can be compared against it | `crapkit ratchet seed` stamps it: [docs: the metric stamp](https://github.com/JeanFrancoisGagne/crapkit/blob/main/docs/ratchet.md#the-metric-stamp) |
| "crapkit: lane 'py': coverage.py report carries no branch data, so the coverage term is statement-based for this artifact — add --cov-branch to the lane command to measure branches", from `crapkit coverage` | The lane scored on statements instead of branches, so CRAP is understated on branchy functions. A report carrying neither branches nor statements is still exit 5 | Add `--cov-branch` to the lane command, then rerun `crapkit coverage`: [docs: pytest](https://github.com/JeanFrancoisGagne/crapkit/blob/main/docs/lanes.md#pytest) |
| "crapkit: lane 'py': coverage.py report has no function regions for 1 of 40 file(s) (tpl/page.html) — those files are skipped and the rest of the report is scored", from `crapkit coverage` | A plugin reporter, django or jinja templates, declares no code regions for those files. Every other file in the report scored. A report where NO file carries regions is still exit 5 | Nothing, unless you expected those files measured: [docs: a file the report carries no regions for](https://github.com/JeanFrancoisGagne/crapkit/blob/main/docs/lanes.md#a-file-the-report-carries-no-regions-for) |

Four more lines come out of `crapkit doctor --plugin-root`, same exit 1.
"crapkit doctor: the plugin at PATH asks for hook protocol N" means the plugin is ahead of
the CLI, so the advisory hook exits 0 in silence on every edit.
"crapkit doctor: the plugin at PATH has no .claude-plugin/plugin.json" means the path is not
a plugin root and holds no crapkit install below it. "crapkit doctor: no installed crapkit
plugin under DIR" means the bare flag found nothing in Claude Code's plugin directory: install
with `claude plugin install crapkit@crapkit`, or pass a PATH.
"crapkit doctor: FAIL no `crapkit` on PATH" means the plugin is installed but the bare name
its hooks and `.mcp.json` spawn resolves nowhere, so every PostToolUse edit fires a command
that cannot start and the MCP server never comes up. A `pip install` into a project `.venv`
is the usual way to land there: `pipx install crapkit`, or point the plugin at the
environment holding it. `crapkit claude-hook` and
`crapkit doctor --plugin-root` are both specified in
[README: subcommands](https://github.com/JeanFrancoisGagne/crapkit/blob/main/README.md#subcommands).

Exit 2 from any other crapkit command is argparse: the subcommand or the flag does not exist
in this version.

## By exit code

| Exit | What refused | Owner | First command |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3 | config: `crapkit.toml` unparseable, a lane command the guard refuses, a metric-stamp mismatch, a `test-scoped` file under no templated scope | [docs: configuration](https://github.com/JeanFrancoisGagne/crapkit/blob/main/docs/configuration.md) | `crapkit doctor` |
| 4 | git: not a repository, or a baseline commit rewritten out of the history | [README: exit codes](https://github.com/JeanFrancoisGagne/crapkit/blob/main/README.md#exit-codes) | `crapkit runs list` |
| 5 | a lane produced no artifact, produced one measuring a different tree or spelling this one absolutely, timed out past its retries, or refused a container | [docs: what a failed lane does to scoring](https://github.com/JeanFrancoisGagne/crapkit/blob/main/docs/lanes.md#what-a-failed-lane-does-to-scoring) | `crapkit coverage --lane NAME` |
| 6 | gate: a function the diff touched is over its ceiling and above any ratchet mark it carries | [AGENTS: gate the edit](https://github.com/JeanFrancoisGagne/crapkit/blob/main/AGENTS.md#3-gate-the-edit) | `crapkit rescore FILE --gate` |
| 7 | ratchet: a marked function scores worse than its recorded mark | [docs: how verify uses the ratchet](https://github.com/JeanFrancoisGagne/crapkit/blob/main/docs/ratchet.md#how-verify-uses-the-ratchet) | `crapkit explain PATH NAME` |
| 8 | a test that passed in the baseline fails now | [README: exit codes](https://github.com/JeanFrancoisGagne/crapkit/blob/main/README.md#exit-codes) | `crapkit test-scoped FILE` |
| 9 | more uncovered changed lines than `diff_uncovered_max` | [docs: configuration](https://github.com/JeanFrancoisGagne/crapkit/blob/main/docs/configuration.md) | `crapkit verify --json` |

`verify` reports the first of 6, 7, 8, 9 that fires, so a fixed 6 can uncover a 7 underneath
it. Exit 1 is three unrelated things at once:
[README: exit 1 means one of three things](https://github.com/JeanFrancoisGagne/crapkit/blob/main/README.md#exit-1-means-one-of-three-things)
splits them by command.

## Two exit-3 signatures worth naming

Exit 3 fires before any lane runs, so nothing was measured and nothing was written.

`ratchet marks were recorded under [crapkit-analysis=7 lizard=1.24.0] but this run
measures [crapkit-analysis=8 lizard=1.24.0]` is an upgrade, not a break. Shell cognitive
complexity nests since analysis 8, so shell numbers moved and CRAP scores from the two
versions are not comparable; ccn did not move. Run `crapkit coverage`, then
`crapkit ratchet seed`: seed stamps the metric of the run it reads, so a seed from a run the
older crapkit measured keeps the old stamp and verify keeps refusing. When a failed verify
pins the baseline, plain seed reads the pinned run. Name the newer one with
`crapkit ratchet seed --baseline N`: on such a store the refusal itself ends with that seed,
under plain `crapkit verify` and under `crapkit verify --baseline N` alike:
[docs: the metric stamp](https://github.com/JeanFrancoisGagne/crapkit/blob/main/docs/ratchet.md#the-metric-stamp).

`lane 'py': positional argument 'slow'' narrows a full-suite coverage run ... (cmd.exe
does not treat ' as a quote: write the value in double quotes)` is the lane guard reading
the command the way the shell will. On Windows a single-quoted value reaches the runner
one word per space, so the guard sees a positional that would narrow the run. Rewrite the
value in double quotes:
[AGENTS: when a lane will not start](https://github.com/JeanFrancoisGagne/crapkit/blob/main/AGENTS.md#when-a-lane-will-not-start).

## a lane that wrote no artifact: seven causes

The lane log names which one. It sits at `.crapkit/lane-<name>.log`; the failure line quotes
its tail and names that path in full, so read the log before guessing — the tail is 500
characters of a file that holds the whole run.

On a lane with `retries` set, every attempt appends to that one file and the cause the
message quotes is read from the LAST attempt alone: the text after the final
`--- attempt N ---` banner line. A retry that died of something else than attempt 1 is
what you are being shown, and the earlier attempts are in the log above that banner, which
is why the path is worth opening. Attempt 1 writes no banner, so a log holding none is a
single attempt and its whole output is in scope.

| Cause | Signature in the log | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| No coverage provider installed, vitest | `MISSING DEPENDENCY '@vitest/coverage-v8'` | [docs: getting an artifact out of vitest](https://github.com/JeanFrancoisGagne/crapkit/blob/main/docs/lanes.md#getting-an-artifact-out-of-vitest) |
| No coverage provider installed, pytest | `unrecognized arguments: --cov`, so pytest-cov is missing from the environment the SUITE runs in, which a pipx or uv-tool install of crapkit never shares | [docs: pytest](https://github.com/JeanFrancoisGagne/crapkit/blob/main/docs/lanes.md#pytest) |
| Tests failed, so the runner wrote no report | a red suite and no file, vitest with `reportOnFailure` unset | [docs: reportOnFailure](https://github.com/JeanFrancoisGagne/crapkit/blob/main/docs/lanes.md#reportonfailure) |
| The report landed somewhere the lane does not name | the suite passed and `artifact` still points at nothing | [docs: where artifacts live](https://github.com/JeanFrancoisGagne/crapkit/blob/main/docs/lanes.md#where-artifacts-live) |
| Killed or refused before it could write | `timed out after Ns (attempt N)`, `wrote no output for Ns (attempt N), so crapkit killed it` (the `no_progress_seconds` watch), or `host-only (container runs OOM)` | [docs: a suite that stops making progress](https://github.com/JeanFrancoisGagne/crapkit/blob/main/docs/lanes.md#a-suite-that-stops-making-progress), [docs: timeouts and retries](https://github.com/JeanFrancoisGagne/crapkit/blob/main/docs/lanes.md#timeouts-and-retries) |
| pytest died during collection, so the coverage plugin wrote nothing | "Interrupted: N error during collection" in the log, with the junit on disk and the coverage JSON missing | Add `--continue-on-collection-errors` to the lane command, which `crapkit init` now writes: [docs: --continue-on-collection-errors](https://github.com/JeanFrancoisGagne/crapkit/blob/main/docs/lanes.md#--continue-on-collection-errors) |
| The lane reran and rewrote nothing | "wrote no artifact this run — the PATH on disk predates it and is the previous run's" | [docs: the artifact has to be the one this run wrote](https://github.com/JeanFrancoisGagne/crapkit/blob/main/docs/lanes.md#the-artifact-has-to-be-the-one-this-run-wrote) |

Before triaging any of the seven, check that the command ran at all. `crapkit doctor` reads
each lane with the shell that will run it and FAILs one whose first word will not start:
`lane 'py': cmd.exe cannot run 'python' (exit 9009)`. On Windows that is usually the Store
`python.exe` alias a stock PATH carries with no Store app behind it, which resolves and
then refuses to run, so nothing that only reads PATH sees it. Point the lane at a python
that runs: [AGENTS: when a lane will not start](https://github.com/JeanFrancoisGagne/crapkit/blob/main/AGENTS.md#when-a-lane-will-not-start).

doctor reads the lane command and nothing behind it. It checks that the first word of every
segment (`&&`, `||`, `&`, `|`) resolves on PATH, and it starts the line's own first word
once, which is the only word it starts. So a lane written as
`npm run test -- --coverage ...` is checked as far as `npm`, and the runner the package
script names is invisible to it. A package that lists `vitest` in `devDependencies` with no
`node_modules` on disk therefore passes doctor and then fails the lane:

    $ crapkit doctor
    ...
    doctor: no problems found
    $ crapkit coverage
    crapkit: lane 'js' FAILED: lane 'js' produced no artifact at .crapkit/cov/js/coverage-final.json (command exit 1); last output: ...
    'vitest' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
    operable program or batch file.

That signature is none of the five. It is `not recognized` on Windows and `not found` from
sh on POSIX, and it means the suite's own dependencies are not installed. Install them,
then rerun `crapkit coverage`.

This is tooling, not your code. What it costs depends on whether any lane survived. A lane
that fails beside a lane that worked still writes a run: the failed lane's scopes fall back
to `no-lane`, the run is typed `partial`, and `verify` refuses to conclude at all. When
EVERY declared lane fails, `coverage` prints a closing count, `crapkit: every lane failed
(N of N); the errors are above`, exits 5 and writes no run at all, so `crapkit runs` has
nothing to show and there is no partial run for `verify` to refuse against. Read the lane
lines above that count; it repeats none of them.

## "measured N file(s), none of them under the paths its scopes declare"

The lane wrote a real artifact, and none of the paths in it reach the scopes the lane
claims — so the join finds nothing and every function in those scopes would score
`untested`. **Read the paths first**: this message comes in three verdicts, two of them exit 5 and
only one of them lets the run score on. The measured paths decide which, and the message quotes a few of
them:

| The paths it reports | Verdict | Cause and fix |
|---|---|---|
| absolute or drive-lettered (`C:/…`) and resolving OUTSIDE this checkout, or climbing out of it (`../…`) | the lane FAILS, **exit 5**; its scopes fall back to `no-lane` | the run measured a different tree: a stale artifact, or the wrong environment. A `python -m pytest` lane binds to whatever venv the shell has active, which in a second worktree is the other checkout's — run the suite through the project's own manager (`uv run python -m pytest …`). On an istanbul lane the reader rebases every path under this checkout's root, so an escaped path means the artifact was written elsewhere: rerun the suite here rather than reusing one copied in or restored from a CI cache. A `../` climb lands here whatever it points at: it is relative to a working directory the artifact never recorded |
| absolute or drive-lettered and resolving UNDER this checkout | the lane FAILS, **exit 5**; its scopes fall back to `no-lane` | right tree, wrong spelling: the runner reported absolute paths and crapkit joins on root-relative ones, so the join finds nothing. Nothing about the environment is wrong. Turn the spelling off at the runner — coverage.py takes `relative_files = true` under `[tool.coverage.run]` in pyproject.toml (or `[run] relative_files = true` in .coveragerc), an istanbul reporter takes its own `cwd`/`root` option — then rerun the lane |
| repo-relative but rooted one level down (`faro/core.py` where the scope is `src`), or no paths at all | a **warning** on stderr and **exit 0**: the run scores on, with every function in those scopes `untested` | the runner reports relative to a subdirectory — set `path_prefix` on the lane (coveragepy only; the istanbul reader never reads that key) — or the greenfield shape, a suite that imports none of the scoped source yet, where `untested` is the right answer and there is nothing to fix |

So a green `crapkit coverage` can still be carrying this: `lane 'py' measured N file(s) …
so every function in those scopes will score untested`. Nothing in either exit-5 row applies
to it. And `path_prefix` only ever PREPENDS, so it cannot rescue an absolute path in the
other direction.

An artifact holding both shapes at once takes the first row. A path from somewhere else
can only have come from somewhere else, and the count in that message names the outside
paths alone, so a refusal reporting fewer paths than the artifact holds is not a miscount.

## Exit 7 on a function you never touched

Test rot, not code rot. A ratchet regression fires whether or not the diff touched the
function, which is the whole point: deleting the coverage behind an untouched function is
enough to raise its CRAP. Start at `crapkit explain PATH NAME`, look for the test that
stopped exercising it, and restore the coverage rather than the code.

## Tainted baseline

`run N is not the baseline: verify run M FAILED with K finding(s)` means the newest run never
cleared its findings, so an older one is being measured against. Two escapes, both
legitimate:

- Fix the findings the older baseline still shows, then rerun `crapkit verify`.
- Accept the newer run by name: `crapkit verify --baseline N`, a visible act somebody can audit later.

The marks take the same name. `crapkit ratchet seed` and `crapkit ratchet prune` read the
run verify would pick, so after a failed verify they read the run before it, and their line
names the newer run they passed over and the `--baseline` that reads it.
`crapkit ratchet seed --baseline N` reads run N instead, refused for the same four reasons
as `crapkit verify --baseline N`. It is the way out when seed refuses the pinned run:
`ambiguous legacy function identity in PATH: NAME in run M; seed reads run M because verify run K FAILED after it`
means run M was stored before crapkit recorded where same-line functions sit, and no
coverage run changes which run seed reads. The line ends with the `--baseline` to pass:
[docs: naming the run to seed from](https://github.com/JeanFrancoisGagne/crapkit/blob/main/docs/ratchet.md#naming-the-run-to-seed-from).

Owner: [README: the trusted baseline](https://github.com/JeanFrancoisGagne/crapkit/blob/main/README.md#the-trusted-baseline).
`crapkit runs list` prints `verdict=-` on runs that rendered no verdict.

The second escape can itself be refused, at exit 1, and the refusal carries the answer:

    crapkit: run 1 is an inventory run (no coverage was measured) and cannot serve as a baseline; trusted runs: 2; pass `--baseline 2` for the newest

Read the middle clause. It names why that run cannot serve, and the four reasons are a
failed verify, a hook run, a partial run (a lane subset, or a lane that failed) and an
inventory run. Then take an id from `trusted runs`, or the one the line hands you. A run
id that is not in the store at all gets a different line naming `crapkit runs`.

## A conflicted crapkit-ratchet.tsv

The `resolving-merge-conflicts` skill's always-resolve rule does not apply to this file. Do
not resolve it by hand and do not take one side: hand-resolution is exactly where a mark gets
raised, which the ratchet exists to forbid. `crapkit ratchet merge` is the resolver, and per
key it takes the side that changed, or the lower value when both did.

A conflict here means the merge driver is not installed in this clone. Install it, then redo
the merge:

    git config merge.crapkit-ratchet.driver "crapkit ratchet merge %O %A %B"

Owner: [docs: the git merge driver](https://github.com/JeanFrancoisGagne/crapkit/blob/main/docs/ratchet.md#the-git-merge-driver).
When the driver itself refuses (`marks from different metric versions cannot merge`),
run `crapkit coverage`, then re-baseline one side with `crapkit ratchet seed`, and merge again.
